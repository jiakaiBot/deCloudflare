# Ethical Issues

"_Don't support this company which is void of ethics_"

"_Your company isn't trustworthy. You claim to enforce DMCA but have many lawsuits for not doing so._"

"_They only censor those who question their ethics._"

## CloudFlare spams people
</summary>


Cloudflare is sending spam emails to non-Cloudflare users.

- Only send emails to subscribers who‚Äôve opted in
- When the user say "stop", then stop sending email

It's that simple. But Cloudflare doesn't care.
Cloudflare said using their service [can stop all spammers or attackers](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170066-Will-activating-Cloudflare-stop-all-spammers-or-attackers-).
How can we stop _Cloudflare spammers_ without activating Cloudflare?

## Share user's private information
</summary>


Cloudflare has a massive [harassment problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20171024040313/http://www.businessinsider.com/cloudflare-ceo-suggests-people-who-report-online-abuse-use-fake-names-2017-5).
Cloudflare [shares personal information](https://archive.ph/ePdvi) of those [who](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/898299709634248704) [complain](https://twitter.com/TinyPirate/status/554718958176067584) [about](https://twitter.com/remembrancermx/status/1010329041235148802) [hosted](https://twitter.com/Bridaguy/status/915003769280172037) [sites](https://twitter.com/HelloAndrew/status/897260208845500416). They sometimes ask you to provide
your true ID. If you don't want to get harassed, [assaulted](https://twitter.com/NiteShade925/status/1158469203420205056), [swatted](https://boingboing.net/2015/01/19/invasion-boards-set-out-to-rui.html) or [killed](https://twitter.com/RusEmbUSA/status/1187363092793040901), you better stay away from Cloudflared websites.

## Corporate solicitation of charitable contributions
</summary>


CloudFlare is [asking](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112033605/https://opencollective.com/cloudflarecollective#section-about) for charitable contributions. It‚Äôs quite appalling that an American corporation would ask for charity alongside non-profit organizations that have good causes. If you like [blocking people or wasting other people's time](PEOPLE.md), you might want to order some pizzasüçï for Cloudflare employees.

## Browser vendor discrimination
</summary>


CloudFlare gives preferential treatment to those using Firefox while giving hostile treatment to users of non-Tor-Browser over Tor.
Tor users of who rightfully refuse to execute non-free javascript also receive hostile treatment.
This access inequality is a network neutrality abuse and an abuse of power.

## Voter suppression
</summary>


Voters in US states register to vote ultimately through the state secretary's website in the state of their residence.
Republican-controlled state secretary offices engage in voter suppression by proxying the state secretary's website through Cloudflare.
Cloudflare's hostile treatment of Tor users, its MITM position as a centralized global point of surveillance, and its detrimental role overall 
makes prospective voters reluctant to register.  Liberals in particular tend to embrace privacy.  Voter registration forms collect sensitive information about a voter's political leaning, personal physical address, social security number, and date of birth.
Most states only make a subset of that information publicly available, but Cloudflare sees ***all*** that information when someone registers to vote.

Note that paper registration does not circumvent Cloudflare because the secretary of state data entry staff workers will likely use the
Cloudflare website to enter the data.

- Change.org is a famous website for gathering votes and take action. "[people everywhere are starting campaigns, mobilizing supporters, and working with decision makers to drive solutions.](https://web.archive.org/web/20200206120027/https://www.change.org/about)"
Unfortunately, many people cannot view change.org at all due to Cloudflare's aggressive filter. They are being blocked from signing the petition, thus excluding them from a democratic process. Using other non-cloudflared platform such as [OpenPetition](https://www.openpetition.eu/content/about_us) helps remedy the problem.

- Cloudflare's "[Athenian Project](https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/)" offers free enterprise-level protection to state and local election websites. They said "_their constituents can access election information and voter registration_" but this is a lie because many people just can't browse the site at all.

## Ignoring user's preference
</summary>


If you opt-out something, you expect that you receive no email about it. Cloudflare ignore user's preference and share data with third-party corporations [without customer's consent](https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1108424723233419264). If you're using their free plan, they sometimes send email to you asking to buy monthly subscription.

## Lying about deleting user's data
</summary>


According to this [ex-cloudflare customer's blog](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/11/can-you-trust-cloudflare-with-your-personal-data/), Cloudflare is lying about deleting accounts. Nowadays, many [companies keep your data](https://justdeleteme.xyz/) after you've closed or removed your account. Most of good companies do mention about it in their privacy policy. Cloudflare? No.

```
2019-08-05 CloudFlare sent me confirmation that they'd removed my account.
2019-10-02 I received an email from CloudFlare "because I am a customer"
```

Cloudflare didn't know about the word "remove". If it is really _removed_, why this ex-customer got an email? He also mentioned that Cloudflare's privacy policy doesn't mention about it.

```
Their new privacy policy doesn't make any mention of retaining data for a year.
```

![](../image/cfviopl_notdel.jpg)

How can you trust Cloudflare if [their privacy policy is a LIE](https://twitter.com/daviddlow/status/1197787135526555648)?

![](../image/cf_deleteandkeep.jpg)

"We have begun to process your deletion request" but "We will continue to store your personal information".

Can you "trust" this?
