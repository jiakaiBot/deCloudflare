[Matthew Browning Prince (Twitter @eastdakota)](https://twitter.com/eastdakota), born on November 13th 1974, is the CEO and co-founder of CloudFlare.

Thanks to his rich dad, [John B. Prince](http://web.archive.org/web/20081002173414/http://www.mufranchisee.com/article/453/), he attended the [University of Chicago Law School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Law_School) ('00) and [Harvard Business School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_School) ('09). Prince taught Internet law and was a specialist in anti-spam laws and phishing investigations.

## Website consumer

- If the website you like is using Cloudflare, tell them not to use Cloudflare.
  - Whining on social media such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon makes no difference. [Actions are louder than hashtags.](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1274132092490862594)
  - Try to contact to the website owner if you want to make yourself useful.

[Cloudflare said](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues/783):
```
We recommend that you reach out to the administrators for the specific services or sites that you run into issue with and share your experience.
```

[If you don't ask for it, website owner never know this problem.](../PEOPLE.md)

![](../image/liberapay.jpg)

[Successful example](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/turn-off-cloudflare-on-counterparty-co-plz/164/5).<br>
You have a problem? [Raise your voice now.](https://github.com/maraoz/maraoz.github.io/issues/1) Example below.

```
You are just helping corporate censorship and mass surveillance.
https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/src/branch/master/README.md
```

```
Your web page is in the privacy-abusing private walled-garden of CloudFlare.
https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/
```

- Take some time to read website's privacy policy.
  - if the website is behind Cloudflare or website is using services connected to Cloudflare.

It must explain what the "Cloudflare" is, and ask for permission to share your data with Cloudflare. Failure to do so will result in the breach of trust and the website in question should be avoided.

[An acceptable privacy policy example is here](https://archive.is/bDlTz) ("Subprocessors" > "Entity Name")

```
I've read your privacy policy and I cannot find the word Cloudflare.
I refuse to share data with you if you continue to feed my data to Cloudflare.
https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/
```

This is an example of privacy policy which does not have the word Cloudflare.
[Liberland Jobs](https://archive.is/daKIr) [privacy policy](https://docsend.com/view/feiwyte):

![](../image/cfwontobey.jpg)

Cloudflare have their own privacy policy.
[Cloudflare loves doxxing people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerGhazi/comments/2s64fe/be_wary_reporting_to_cloudflare/)

Here's a good example for website's signup form.
AFAIK, zero website do this. Will you trust them?

```
By clicking ‚ÄúSign up for XYZ‚Äù, you agree to our terms of service and privacy statement.
You also agree to share your data with Cloudflare and also agrees to cloudflare's privacy statement.
If Cloudflare leak your information or won't let you to connect to our servers, it's not our fault. [*]

[ Sign up ] [ I disagree ]
```
[*] [PEOPLE.md](../PEOPLE.md)


- Try not to use their service. Remember you are being watched by Cloudflare.
  - ["I'm in your TLS, sniffin' your passworz"](../image/iminurtls.jpg)

- Search for other website. There are alternatives and opportunites on the internet!

- Convince your friends to use Tor on the daily basis.
  - Anonymity should be the standard of the open internet!
  - [Do note that the Tor project dislikes this project.](../HISTORY.md)

- "Decentraleyes" can stop connection to "CDNJS (Cloudflare)".
  - It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking.
  - The developer replied: "[very concerning indeed](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/issues/236#issuecomment-352049501)", "[widespread usage severely centralizes the web](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes/issues/251#issuecomment-366752049)"

- Using Cloudflare will increase chances of an outage. Visitors can't access to your website if your server is down or Cloudflare is down.

- Using Cloudflare to proxy your "API service", "software update server" or "RSS feed" will harm your customer. A customer called you and said "I can't use your API anymore", and you have no idea what is going on. Cloudflare can silently block your customer. Do you think it is okay?

- Redirect or block "Cloudflare Warp" users from accessing your website. And provide a reason if you can.

- Discord is using CloudFlare. Alternatives? We recommend [**Briar** (Android)](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.briarproject.briar.android/), [Ricochet (PC)](https://ricochet.im/), [Tox + Tor (Android/PC)](https://tox.chat/download.html)
  - Briar includes Tor daemon so you don't have to install Orbot.
  - Qwtch developers, Open Privacy, deleted stop_cloudflare project from their git service without notice.

- If you use Debian GNU/Linux, or any derivative, subscribe: [bug #831835](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=831835). And if you can, help verify the patch, and help the maintainer come to the right conclusion on whether it should be accepted.

- Always recommend these browsers.

Other software's privacy is imperfect. This doesn't mean Tor browser is "perfect".
There is no 100% secure nor 100% private on the internet and technology.

## Action
</summary>


- Tell others around you about the dangers of Cloudflare.

- [Help improve this repository.](https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor).
  - Both the lists, the arguments against it and the details.

- [Document and make very public where things go wrong with Cloudflare (and similar companies), making sure to mention this repository when you do so](https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor) :)

- Get more people using Tor by default so they can experience the web from the perspective of different parts of the world.

- Start groups, in social media and meatspace, dedicated to liberating the world from Cloudflare.

- Where appropriate, link to these groups on this repository - this can be a place for coordinating working together as groups.

- [Start a coop that can provide a meaningful non corporate alternative to Cloudflare.](../subfiles/cloudflare-alternatives.md)

- Let us know of any alternatives to help at least provide multiple layered defence against Cloudflare.

- If you are a Cloudflare customer, set your privacy settings, and wait for them to violate them.
  - [Then bring them under anti-spam / privacy violation charges.](https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1108424723233419264)

- If you are in the United States of America and the website in question is a bank or an accountant, try to bring legal pressure under the Gramm‚ÄìLeach‚ÄìBliley Act, or the Americans with DIsabilities Act and report back to us how far you get.

- If the website is a government site, try to bring legal pressure under the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution.

- If you are EU citizen, contact the website to send your personal information under the General Data Protection Regulation. If they refuse to give you your information, that's a violation of the law.

- For companies that claim to offer service on their website try reporting them as "false advertising" to consumer protection organizations and BBB. Cloudflare websites are served by Cloudflare servers.

- [The ITU suggest in the US context that Cloudflare is starting to get big enough that antitrust law might be brought down upon them.](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/Workshops-and-Seminars/20181218/Documents/Geoff_Huston_Presentation.pdf)

- It's conceivable that the GNU GPL version 4 could include a provision against storing source code behind such a service, requiring for all GPLv4 and later programs that at least the source code is accessible via a medium that does not discriminate against Tor users.

### Comments

```
There is always hope in resistance.

Resistance is fertile.

Even some of the darker outcomes comes to be, the very act of resistance trains us to continue to destabilize the dystopic status quo that results.

Resist!

Someday, you'll understand why we wrote this.

There isn't anything futuristic about this. We have already lost.
