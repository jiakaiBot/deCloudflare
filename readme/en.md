One thing, I don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
<br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
To explain in due time all I know<br>
<br>
Time is a valuable thing<br>
<br>
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal<br>
<br>
Didn't look out below<br>
Watch the time go right out the window<br>
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know<br>
I wasted it all just to watch you go<br>
<br>
I kept everything inside<br>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>
What it meant to me will eventually be<br>
A memory of a time when I tried so hard<br>
<br>
I tried so hard and got so far<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
I had to fall to lose it all<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
<br>
One thing, I don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
<br>
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
To remind myself how I tried so hard<br>
<br>
In spite of the way you were mockin' me<br>
Actin' like I was part of your property<br>
<br>
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me<br>
I'm surprised it got so far<br>
<br>
Things aren't the way they were before<br>
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br>
<br>
Not that you knew me back then<br>
But it all comes back to me in the end<br>
<br>
You kept everything inside<br>
And even though I tried, it all fell apart<br>
<br>
What it meant to me will eventually be<br>
A memory of a time when I tried so hard<br>
<br>
I tried so hard and got so far<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
I had to fall to lose it all<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
<br>
I've put my trust in you<br>
Pushed as far as I can go<br>
For all this<br>
There's only one thing you should know<br>
<br>
I've put my trust in you<br>

For all this<br>
There's only one thing you should know<br>

I tried so hard and got so far<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
I had to fall to lose it all<br>
But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
<br>
We don't know why<br>
We really don't know why<br>
It doesn't even matter how hard we tried<br>
<br>
