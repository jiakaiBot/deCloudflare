actnl0000	If the website you like is using Cloudflare, tell them not to use Cloudflare.
actnl0001	Whining on social media such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter or Mastodon makes no difference.
actnl0002	Actions are louder than hashtags.
actnl0003	Try to contact to the website owner if you want to make yourself useful.
actnl0004	Cloudflare said
actnl0005	We recommend that you reach out to the administrators for the specific services or sites that you run into issue with and share your experience.
actnl0006	If you don't ask for it, website owner never know this problem.

actnl0010	Example below.
actnl0011	You are just helping corporate censorship and mass surveillance.
actnl0012	Your web page is in the privacy-abusing private walled-garden of CloudFlare.
actnl0013	Take some time to read website's privacy policy.
actnl0014	if the website is behind Cloudflare or website is using services connected to Cloudflare.
actnl0015	It must explain what the "Cloudflare" is, and ask for permission to share your data with Cloudflare.
actnl0016	Failure to do so will result in the breach of trust and the website in question should be avoided.
actnl0017	An acceptable privacy policy example is here
actnl0018	I've read your privacy policy and I cannot find the word Cloudflare.
actnl0019	I refuse to share data with you if you continue to feed my data to Cloudflare.
actnl0020	This is an example of privacy policy which does not have the word Cloudflare.
actnl0021	Cloudflare have their own privacy policy.
actnl0022	Cloudflare loves doxxing people.
actnl0023	Here's a good example for website's signup form.
actnl0024	AFAIK, zero website do this. Will you trust them?
actnl0025	By clicking “Sign up for XYZ”, you agree to our terms of service and privacy statement.
actnl0026	You also agree to share your data with Cloudflare and also agrees to cloudflare's privacy statement.
actnl0027	If Cloudflare leak your information or won't let you to connect to our servers, it's not our fault.
actnl0028	Sign up
actnl0029	I disagree
actnl0030	Try not to use their service.

actnl0034	Convince your friends to use Tor on the daily basis.
actnl0035	Anonymity should be the standard of the open internet!
actnl0036	Do note that the Tor project dislikes this project.
actnl0037	If your browser is Firefox, Tor Browser, or Ungoogled Chromium use one of these add-ons below.
actnl0038	If you want to add other new add-on ask about it first.
actnl0039	"Decentraleyes" can stop connection to "CDNJS (Cloudflare)".
actnl0040	It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking.
actnl0041	The developer replied
actnl0042	You can also remove or distrust Cloudflare certificate from your Certificate Authority(CA).
actnl0044	Do not use Cloudflare solution, Period.
actnl0045	You can do better than that, right?
actnl0046	Here's how to remove Cloudflare subscriptions, plans, domains, or accounts.
actnl0043	Want more customers?
actnl0047	You know what to do.
actnl0048	Hint is "above line".
actnl0049	Using Cloudflare will increase chances of an outage.
actnl0050	Visitors can't access to your website if your server is down or Cloudflare is down.
actnl0051	Did you really think Cloudflare never go down?
actnl0052	Using Cloudflare to proxy your "API service", "software update server" or "RSS feed" will harm your customer.
actnl0053	A customer called you and said "I can't use your API anymore", and you have no idea what is going on.
actnl0054	Cloudflare can silently block your customer.
actnl0055	Do you think it is okay?
actnl0056	There are many RSS reader client and RSS reader online service.
actnl0057	Why are you publishing RSS feed if you're not allowing people to subscribe?

actnl0059	Use "Let's Encrypt" or just buy it from CA company.
actnl0060	Do you need DNS server?

actnl0064	Looking for hosting service?
actnl0065	Free only?
actnl0066	Alternatives to Cloudflare
actnl0067	Are you using "cloudflare-ipfs.com"?
actnl0068	Do you know Cloudflare IPFS is bad?
actnl0069	Install Web Application Firewall such as OWASP and Fail2Ban on your server and configure it properly.
actnl0070	Blocking Tor is not a solution. Don't punish everyone just for small bad users.
actnl0071	Redirect or block "Cloudflare Warp" users from accessing your website.
actnl0072	And provide a reason if you can.
actnl0073	IP list
actnl0074	Cloudflare’s current IP ranges
actnl0075	Just block them
actnl0076	Redirect to warning page

actnl0078	Ask for advice from other Clearnet/Tor dual website operators and make anonymous friends!

actnl0085	And if you can, help verify the patch, and help the maintainer come to the right conclusion on whether it should be accepted.
actnl0086	Always recommend these browsers.
actnl0087	Other software's privacy is imperfect.
actnl0088	This doesn't mean Tor browser is "perfect".
actnl0089	There is no 100% secure nor 100% private on the internet and technology.

actnl0101	Why are you blocking Tor Or VPN?
actnl0102	And why are you blocking temporary emails?
actnl0103	Comment
actnl0104	Let's talk about other software's privacy.
actnl0105	If you really need to use Firefox, pick "Firefox ESR".
actnl0106	Firefox - Spyware Watchdog
actnl0107	Firefox rejects free speech, bans free speech
actnl0108	100+ downvotes. It seems like asking a software company to stick to... software is just too much these days.
actnl0109	Uh, why is Firefox showing me sponsored links in my URL bar?
actnl0110	Remember, Mozilla is using Cloudflare service.
actnl0111	They're also using Cloudflare's DNS service on their product.
actnl0112	Mozilla officially rejected this ticket.
actnl0113	Mozilla - Devil Incarnate
actnl0114	Firefox Focus is a joke.
actnl0115	They promised to turn off telemetry but they changed it.
actnl0116	PaleMoon/Basilisk developer loves Cloudflare.
actnl0117	Pale Moon's Archive Server hacked and spread malware for 18 Months
actnl0118	He also hate Tor users
actnl0119	Let it be hostile towards Tor. I think most sites should be hostile towards Tor considering its extremely high abuse factor.
actnl0120	Waterfox have severe "phones home" problem
actnl0121	Google Chrome is a spyware.
actnl0122	Google profiles your activity.
actnl0123	SRWare Iron make too many phones home connection.

actnl0125	Brave Browser whitelist Facebook/Twitter trackers.
actnl0126	Here's more issues.

actnl0129	Vivaldi does not respect your privacy.
actnl0130	Opera spyware level: Extremely High
actnl0131	You shouldn't be using iOS at all, mainly because it is malware.
actnl0132	Therefore we recommend above table only. Nothing else.
actnl0133	"Firefox Nightly" will send debug-level information to Mozilla servers without opt-out method.
actnl0134	Mozilla servers are behing Cloudflare
actnl0135	It is possible to prohibit Firefox to connect to Mozilla servers.
actnl0136	Mozilla's policy-templates guide
actnl0137	Keep in mind this trick might stop working in later version because Mozilla likes to whitelist themselves.
actnl0138	Use firewall and DNS filter to block them completely.
actnl0139	Report a bug on mozilla's tracker, telling them not to use Cloudflare.
actnl0140	There was a bug report on bugzilla. Many people were posted their concern, however the bug was hidden by the admin in 2018.
actnl0141	You can disable DoH in Firefox.
actnl0142	Change default DNS provider of firefox
actnl0143	If you would like to use non-ISP DNS, consider using OpenNIC Tier2 DNS service  or any of non-Cloudflare DNS services.
actnl0144	Block Cloudflare with DNS.
actnl0145	You can use Tor as DNS resolver.
actnl0146	If you're not Tor expert, ask question here.
actnl0147	How?
actnl0148	Download Tor and install it on your computer.
actnl0149	Add this line to "torrc" file.
actnl0150	Restart Tor.
actnl0151	Set your computer's DNS server to "127.0.0.1".
actnl0152	Tell others around you about the dangers of Cloudflare.
actnl0153	Help improve this repository.
actnl0154	Both the lists, the arguments against it and the details.
actnl0155	Document and make very public where things go wrong with Cloudflare (and similar companies), making sure to mention this repository when you do so
actnl0156	Get more people using Tor by default so they can experience the web from the perspective of different parts of the world.
actnl0157	Start groups, in social media and meatspace, dedicated to liberating the world from Cloudflare.
actnl0158	Where appropriate, link to these groups on this repository - this can be a place for coordinating working together as groups.
actnl0159	Start a coop that can provide a meaningful non corporate alternative to Cloudflare.
actnl0160	Let us know of any alternatives to help at least provide multiple layered defence against Cloudflare.
actnl0161	If you are a Cloudflare customer, set your privacy settings, and wait for them to violate them.
actnl0162	Then bring them under anti-spam / privacy violation charges.
actnl0163	If you are in the United States of America and the website in question is a bank or an accountant, try to bring legal pressure under the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, or the Americans with DIsabilities Act and report back to us how far you get.
actnl0164	If the website is a government site, try to bring legal pressure under the 1st Amendment of the US Constitution.
actnl0165	If you are EU citizen, contact the website to send your personal information under the General Data Protection Regulation. If they refuse to give you your information, that's a violation of the law.
actnl0166	For companies that claim to offer service on their website try reporting them as "false advertising" to consumer protection organizations and BBB.
actnl0167	Cloudflare websites are served by Cloudflare servers.
actnl0168	The ITU suggest in the US context that Cloudflare is starting to get big enough that antitrust law might be brought down upon them.
actnl0169	It's conceivable that the GNU GPL version 4 could include a provision against storing source code behind such a service, requiring for all GPLv4 and later programs that at least the source code is accessible via a medium that does not discriminate against Tor users.
actnl0170	There is always hope in resistance.
actnl0171	Resistance is fertile.
actnl0172	Even some of the darker outcomes comes to be, the very act of resistance trains us to continue to destabilize the dystopic status quo that results.
actnl0173	Resist!
actnl0174	Someday, you'll understand why we wrote this.
actnl0175	There isn't anything futuristic about this. We have already lost.
