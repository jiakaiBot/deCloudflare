Q) It's inevitabble that Cloudflare is going to take over the web.  We can't stop them.  Small website providers
will be strongarmed into using them via DDOScoin[2] and that's that.

A) There is always hope in resistance.  Resistance is fertile[1].  Even some of the darker outcomes

to continue to destabilize the dystopic status quo that results.  Resist!
