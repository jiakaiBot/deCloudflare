gnuradio.org	[flossp]	<= mention (the cloudflare implemented) tor's ban on #gnuradio irc / freenode, get kicked out of the channel (the guy in charge of the radio wildebeest former military - the navy, because neoconservatism is not surprising), note that gnuradio was invited fosdem 2017. imo it's a bad idea for fosdem organizers invite tor-hostile projects, because it presents itself as open to all, and not any - the exclusive corporate fenced garden. please complain at fosdem reps on this occasion .. might ppl must send conduct@fosdem.org. in principle, it would be good to have an anti-gnuradio demonstration at fosdem, but i know that the team is not organized against cloudflare enough to pull it off.
