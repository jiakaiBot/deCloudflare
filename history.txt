= Project History

This project was started by Shiro ( @shiromarieke@birdsite ) CryptoParty Berlin ( @cryptopartybln@birdsite ).  Shiro handed over support to the greater internet in summer 2016.

It was a text list on okfn.org text pad: ( https://pad.okfn.org/p/cloudflare-tor / https://pad.okfn.org/p/noncloudflare-torblocks )

However it was pointed out that this website itself was on cloudflare, and cloudflare broke tor users access to it.

So it was moved to systemli.org : ( https://pad.systemli.org/p/noncloudflare-torblocks )
and an onion service ( HTTP://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/noncloudflare-torblocks / http://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/cloudflare-tor / http://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/cloudflare-philosophy )

These systemli pads needed to be updated once in every while (week? month?) or the whole list was scrubbed.  
This happened a few times, and there were some attempts at vandalism up to and including june 2016
 
A fork was made during a multi-day outage at http://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/fuckcloudflare/cloudflare-tor/ (new, not GitHub repo)

However vola7ileiax4ueow's git service went down, so it was moved to github

There used to also be a list of websites that *were* on cloudflare but are no longer. This list has been lost 
( it was on https://pad.systemli.org/p/ex-cloudflare-tor )
