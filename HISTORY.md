The log file from your iOS app shows that you do track personal information, like device name, UUID, and an identifier - install_id That contradicts what you have in your blogpost - “We don't write user-identifiable log data to disk”

So why did I get that email anyway if I'm opted out of all email communication in the account settings?
Which part of the privacy policy allows you to share data with marketing crap like trustpilot?

Let's test: https://danwin1210.me/url.php?id=39706

```
archive.today
CloudFlare: (None)
Google: A 46.17.42.43 (Russia, AS51659 LLC Baxet)
```

```
archive.is
CloudFlare: A 104.16.181.15 (NSA, AS13335 Cloudflare, Inc.)
Google: A 46.17.42.43 (Russia, AS51659)
```

Why these results are completely different!?

"client was trying to make session requests to their API servers
but before I can prevent it, cloudflare had me blocked.
It's pretty bad as half the internet is behind Cloudflare."

Take a look at Cloudflare's transparency report, "Some things we have never done" section.

```
Cloudflare has never terminated a customer or taken down content due to political pressure.*
```

If you're using SumatraPDF, you won't notice * is a link to https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-criticism/ .
Apparently they've terminated a political account.
Do you think it's okay to make a false statement and hide a link to tiny asterisk?

"In a not-so-distant future, if we're not there already, it may be that if you're
going to put content on the Internet you'll need to use a company with a giant
network like Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, or Alibaba."

Net neutrality is but a skirmish in this larger struggle for control to monopolize all global digital communications.

### Previous 


This project was started by Marie Gutbub (Shiro) ([@shiromarieke](https://twitter.com/shiromarieke)) and CryptoParty Berlin ([@cryptopartybln](https://twitter.com/CryptoPartyBER)).

Shiro handed over support to the greater internet in summer 2016.


It was a text list on okfn.org text pad: (https://pad.okfn.org/p/cloudflare-tor and https://pad.okfn.org/p/noncloudflare-torblocks)


However it was pointed out that this website itself was on Cloudflare, and cloudflare actively blocked Tor users to access it.


So it was moved to systemli.org : ( https://pad.systemli.org/p/noncloudflare-torblocks )
and an onion service ( http://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/noncloudflare-torblocks , http://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/cloudflare-tor , http://j7652k4sod2azfu6.onion/p/cloudflare-philosophy )


These systemli pads needed to be updated once in every while (week? month?) or the whole list was scrubbed.  
This happened a few times, and there were some attempts at vandalism up to and including june 2016.
 
 
A fork was made during a multi-day outage at http://git.vola7ileiax4ueow.onion/fuckcloudflare/cloudflare-tor/ (new, not GitHub repo)


However vola7ileiax4ueow's git service went down, so it was moved to github


There used to also be a list of websites that *were* on cloudflare but are no longer.
This list has been lost ( it was on https://pad.systemli.org/p/ex-cloudflare-tor )
