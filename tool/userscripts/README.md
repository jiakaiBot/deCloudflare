# UserScript

If your browser cannot install an add-on but has [UserScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) functionality, you can use the following UserScript to address the issue of Cloudflare links hiding in every website you visit. 
This script can help you gain similar power to identify and take action against those links. 
However, keep in mind that there may be some limitations due to your browser's restrictions. 
If you can use "[Are links vulnerable to MITM attack?](../../subfiles/addon/ismm.md)" add-on, it is **recommended** to use it instead of the script for better protection and performance. 

### The UserScript (pick only ONE)

- From this git (latest)
  - [Remove CF link](cf.remove.user.js); Remove the link
  - [Color CF link](cf.color.user.js); Mark the link
  - [Replace CF link](cf.replace.user.js); Mark & Replace the link to archived page
- From Greasy Fork (mirror)
