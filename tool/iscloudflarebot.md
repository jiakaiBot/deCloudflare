### Why these toots are not listed in public timeline?

Read https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/issues/25

You will receive only `unlisted` toots from this bot.


### I love Cloudflare! Please stop replying to me!!

Very well, there are 2 ways to complete your request.


> A. Just block this bot from your Mastodon.

The bot will continue replying to you but you won't see any messages.


> B. Do "_Blocklist request_".

If you follow this instruction, the bot will `permanently remember you` and won't send
any notification. `You cannot undo this action because it is automated`.

Here's what you need to do:


**1.** Create a new `public` toot.

Write `I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!` and post it `publicly`.
Other message type, `unlisted` or `private` will be ignored by bot.

_Good example_

`I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!`

_Bad example_

(do not include new line)
```
I am supporting Cloudflare.
Cloudflare is great!
```

(do not include hashtag)
`I am supporting #Cloudflare. Cloudflare is #great!`

(not public message)
`@iscloudflare Hey! I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!`


**2**. The bot will detect it.

- If you post above sentence and delete it immediately, the bot will not notice it so `keep your toot at least 6 hours`.
- If your account is not famous, your toot might not get delivered to the bot instance. Your toot should appear on [this public timeline website](https://ieji.de/public).


**3**. After that, you will no longer receive any replies. Congratulations.

If you still receive a reply, make sure you follow step 1.
Do not include any extra words or hashtag.
