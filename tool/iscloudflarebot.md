### What's this bot?

Read https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/issues/25


### Why these toots are not listed in public timeline?

Read https://codeberg.org/crimeflare/cloudflare-tor/issues/25

The bot will only create `unlisted` toots.


### I love Cloudflare! I don't care! Please stop replying to me!!

Very well, there are 2 ways to complete your request.


> A. Just block this bot from your Mastodon.

The bot will continue replying to you but `you won't see any messages`.


> B. Do "_Blocklist request_".

If you follow this instruction, the bot will `permanently remember you` and won't send
any notification. `You cannot undo this action because it is automated`.

Here's what you need to do:


**1.** Create a new `public` toot. Write `I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!` and post it `publicly`.

_Good example_

`I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!`

_Bad example_

```
I am supporting Cloudflare.
Cloudflare is great!
```

`I am supporting #Cloudflare. Cloudflare is #great!`

`@iscloudflare Hey! I am supporting Cloudflare. Cloudflare is great!`


**2**. The bot will detect it.

If you post above sentence and delete it immediately, the bot will not notice it so keep your toot at least 1 hour.

**3**. After that, you will no longer receive any replies. Congratulations.

If you still receive a reply, make sure you follow step 1.
Do not include any extra words or hashtag.
