### Unwanted spam emails

Cloudflare is sending spam emails to non-Cloudflare users.

- Only send emails to subscribers who‚Äôve opted in
- When the user say "stop", then stop sending email

It's that simple. But Cloudflare don't care.
Cloudflare said using their service [can stop all spammers or attackers](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170066-Will-activating-Cloudflare-stop-all-spammers-or-attackers-).
How can we stop _Cloudflare spammers_ without activating Cloudflare?

### Remove user's review

Cloudflare censor [negative reviews](https://web.archive.org/web/20191116004046/https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5aa6ee0ed5a5700a7c8cf853). If you post _anti-Cloudflare_ text on Twitter, you have a chance to get a [reply](https://twitter.com/CloudflareHelp/status/1126051764917145601) from [Cloudflare employee](cloudflare_inc/cloudflare_members.txt) with "_[No, it's not](PEOPLE.md)_" message. If you post a negative review on any review site, they will try to [censor](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1178836176985366529) [it](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1178722159432220672).

### Doxxing users


Cloudflare has a massive [harassment problem](https://web.archive.org/web/20171024040313/http://www.businessinsider.com/cloudflare-ceo-suggests-people-who-report-online-abuse-use-fake-names-2017-5).
Cloudflare [shares personal information](https://archive.ph/ePdvi) of those [who](https://twitter.com/ZJemptv/status/898299709634248704) [complain](https://twitter.com/TinyPirate/status/554718958176067584) [about](https://twitter.com/remembrancermx/status/1010329041235148802) [hosted](https://twitter.com/Bridaguy/status/915003769280172037) [sites](https://twitter.com/HelloAndrew/status/897260208845500416). They sometimes ask you to provide
your true ID. If you don't want to get harassed, [assaulted](https://twitter.com/NiteShade925/status/1158469203420205056), [swatted](https://boingboing.net/2015/01/19/invasion-boards-set-out-to-rui.html) or [killed](https://twitter.com/RusEmbUSA/status/1187363092793040901), you better stay away from Cloudflared websites.

### Charitable contributions

CloudFlare is asking for [charitable contributions](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112033605/https://opencollective.com/cloudflarecollective#section-about). It‚Äôs quite appalling that an American corporation would ask for charity alongside non-profit organizations that have good causes. If you like [blocking people or wasting other people's time](PEOPLE.md), you might want to order some pizzaüçï for Cloudflare employees.

### Terminating sites

What will you do if your site goes down _suddenly_? There are reports that Cloudflare is [deleting](https://twitter.com/stefan_eady/status/1126033791267426304) [user's](https://twitter.com/derivativeburke/status/903755267053117440) [configuration](https://twitter.com/lordscarlet/status/1046785164792205314) [silently](https://twitter.com/BlnaryMlke/status/1194339461984854018). We suggest you find [better provider](what-to-do.md).
