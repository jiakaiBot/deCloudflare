### Unwanted spam emails

Cloudflare is sending spam emails to non-Cloudflare users.

`Only send emails to subscribers whoâ€™ve opted in.`

`When the user say "stop", then stop sending email.`

It's that simple. But Cloudflare don't care.
Cloudflare said using their service [can stop all spammers or attackers](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170066-Will-activating-Cloudflare-stop-all-spammers-or-attackers-).
How can we stop _Cloudflare spammers_ without activating Cloudflare?
