- "_I don't want to get into the Cloudflare debate right now. Cloudflare is a large player because web sites trust them. That trust isn't something Tor Browser or the Tor network can/should protest._"<br>

- "_Cloudflare is essentially a cdn. Characterizing it as a MITM is disingenuous._"<br>

- "_Let it be hostile towards Tor. I think most sites should be hostile towards Tor considering its extremely high abuse factor._"<br>"_it's clearly a crusade against cloudflare started by disgruntled TOR users about being challenged by CF's captcha policy for TOR traffic and has no valid background other than political._"<br>

- "_Blocking an entire CDN would be a major change to either Tor or
Tor Browser's design. It's not likely to happen, because of the
security vs usability tradeoff. Significantly reducing the usability of Tor would decrease the number of users, making Tor's anonymity set smaller, and reducing anonymity for everyone._"<br>
