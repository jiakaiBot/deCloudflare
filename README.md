# The Great Cloudwall

The Great Cloudwall is [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com).  It is called this in reference to the [Great Firewall of China](http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/) which does a comparable job of filtering out *some* people from seeing web content(ie everyone in mainland china and some people outside) while at the same time those not affected to see a dratically different web, a web free of censorship of such images as ["tank man"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man).  Cloudflare similarly prevents those in southeast asia and elsewhere who have poor internet connectivity from accessing the websites behind it(for example, they could be behind 7+ layers of NAT) unless they solve a CAPTCHA.

This repository is a list of websites that are behind The Great Cloudwall,
websites who human beings have tried to access and have been [either](merely-using-cloudflare.txt) [blocked](cloudflare-list.txt) [from](cloudflare-tor-hostile-list.txt) or [suspect they will be](cloudflare-tor-hostile-list.txt).  Or [Cloudflare's competitors](non-cloudflare-list.txt).

There is more details of why what they are doing is wrong available [here](cloudflare-philosophy.txt).

There are [other](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor) [lists](https://github.com/pirate/sites-using-cloudflare), but this one is one where every entry on the list a human being has actually tried
to go to, and has been blocked.
