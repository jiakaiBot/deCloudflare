It's pretty sad when even the hometown paper is behind the greatcloudwall.
C'mon guys. Stop using Cloudflare.
It's endangering the world wide web and you're blocking readers who are protecting
their privacy by using Tor.
```
-- [Jeff Cliff](https://shitposter.club/jeffcliff/)


```
Man-in-the-middle attack is a serious offense.
If you‚Ä≤re using Cloudflare on your website, you won‚Ä≤t get first rank.
You shouldn‚Ä≤t use it if you value visitor‚Ä≤s privacy.
```
-- [Ss](https://sercxi.nnpaefp7pkadbxxkhz2agtbv2a4g5sgo2fbmv3i7czaua354334uqqad.onion/)


```
I say it's a bad idea to pimp CloudFlare sites and expect such repressions to go unchallenged.
Activism is a duty & ethics trumps netiquette.
Posting original information exclusively on onion sites
is like affirmative action for the repressed Tor community.
Correcting the wrongs of CloudFlare entails some unfair discrimination against clearnet users.
```

- honestly had forgotten why we rejected LBRY, that's why we are slowly developing a BLOCKMARKING system.Rather than going "Oh crap, its Cloudflare!" we are actively blockmarking now.The Cloudflared web is pervasive. By giving them content remember you are help people to stay on that service and therefore might be inadvertently helping cf to surveil those people (and yourself if you want to interact with those ppl. Why we produced fediFlyers ;)It's fully up to you, though. ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106125752340312118))
- What I like about the Vivaldi web browser is that it feels like the team is actually trying to make a better, for some value of that word, browser; not just Chrome with some shtick added/removed. I get useful stuff I want to have straight out of the box, not just another surveillance capitalism tour de force, Cloudflare dependency or cryptocurrency shrill. ([steinar](https://snabelen.no/@Steinar/106120498395822356))
- As Tor users become increasingly marginalized (proportional to the growth of Cloudflare), there is a tiny community within the Tor community who is even more acutely marginized: Tor users who are ethical enough to avoid Cloudflare sites rather than just using TorBrowser as a CAPTCHA circumvention. TorProject & EFF are on the wrong side of this as they look the other way. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106120592802255375))
- the most fun ive had with for is going through kf thread and everybody was is posting just archive.md links and not original links and that shitty site has cloudflare or something and it requires to complete google captcha Every Damn Time i wanna look at archive ([kk](https://pl.sadx.moe/objects/2923cadf-f62e-45f4-b810-e4db7f5e27e6))
- I am usure if it is a good style to operate element website which is a decentralized solution behind a very strong centralizing cloudflare service. The matrix site is free of this centralize hard stuff for the net. ([kmj](https://mastodon.ctseuro.com/@kmj/106115095366141235))
- How can we call regular companies not to use cloudflare or not to ban tor exit nodes if entities which claim that they are super privacy oriented use this word only because of its hype.Session - getsession.org - cloudflare.pinephone - they confirmed that privacy is only a nice byproduct(sic!). You cannot use tor to sign up in their forum. You cannot connect to their IRC using tor.We are just Don Quixotes. Saaaad.@session ([br0m3x](https://social.weho.st/@Br0m3x/106114249620091706))
- in this case the site you were trying to access should be avoided anyway. alternativeto.net is a Tor-blocking Cloudflare site. We need an alternative to alternativeto.net :) ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106110132925701737))
- What DNS provider do you use and why? I use DNS Watch by default as it's preset in Pihole and my modem. I was originally drawn to Cloudflare for its promises of privacy and no censorship, but I've since noticed all the bad press. I'm interested in OpenDNS and LibreDNS but it would be good to read some kind of in-depth comparison if one is available. networking homenetwork FOSS ([syntax](https://social.privacytools.io/@syntax/106104567019673305))
- Next website RSS unavailable for RSS-Reader: lolnein comics. Thanks cloudflare Why is there nobody at Cloudflare bringing the idea up that feeds should be less restrictive by default? ([lemming](https://chaos.social/@lemming/106101921586938623))
- chg dot org, moveon, & actionnetwork are all Tor-blocking Cloudflare sites. This is what Cloudflare impeding democracy looks like. It gives a "one more step" page and shows a broken CAPTCHA ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018779179419354))
- I don't sign petitions on Cloudflare sites. I can't even read it. But I might sign it if it were on a site like openpetition.org. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018735693132453))
- And Visa is even more reckless than Mastercard, as in exposes your card to CloudFlare, who can link that to ~30% of what CF sees in your web traffic (your identity under a microscope). So that's also a catch22. And the thing is, they aren't offering the opt-out b/c they want to. A law is forcing them to. The trap they're using likely puts them in violation of the law. ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/105986349939062443))
- So elementaryOS calls themselves "privacy-respecting" as the very 1st opening statement of their CloudFlare website. Hypocrisy indeed. ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/105984790472219324))
- Wenn man sich in Berlin gegen Corona / Covid impfen lassen will, mu√ü man sich bei Doctolib anmelden. Anscheinend gehen alle Daten √ºber Cloudflare USA und werden dann eventuell bei Amazon AWS gespeichert. Was ist mit dem Datenschutz? Kann man keine Impfung kriegen ohne pers√∂nliche Daten mit diesen Konzernen zu teilen?(@lfdi - in BaW√º wird Doctolib offenbar f√ºr Testterminvergabe eingesetzt?) ([debacle](https://framapiaf.org/@debacle/105972511452684056))
- indeed the guy is really grasping at straws to try to run smear campaigns. Before reading anything, it was obvious that not only is privacyWatchdogIO using a CloudFlare DNS, they are proxying through CF with a config to block Tor users. The About page really makes it clear the guy is a jackass. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105962994557048605))
- I switched my main domain name over to njalla and I&apos;m happy to be on the path toward becoming cloudflare free. It&apos;s quite cost prohibitive though, so I&apos;m definitely rethinking the quantity of domains that I own. Probably for the best that I shimmy things down anyway. Three domain names will cost $60/year, which is crazy, but worth it to support a much needed project :) dns registrar domains ([kvvpa](https://mastodon.social/@kvvpa/106095066092843919))

- Ich habe jetzt mal Blokada 5 installiert (ohne Account) und in der Android Anzeige steht jetzt "Aktiv - Schutz: Mittel - Cloudflare".Was soll den das bedeuten und wie werde ich da Cloudflare wieder los? ([favstarmafia](https://social.anoxinon.de/@favstarmafia/106046678515340208))
- Vivimos en un mundo que dice fomentar la automatizaci√≥n, pero cuando los usuarios automatizamos parte de nuestra actividad en internet para recuperar parte de nuestra soberania digital nos meten el puto cloudflare ray. ([sergiotarxz](https://pleroma.aspie.freemyip.com/objects/cefaa30b-6842-40bf-a762-5990209b5d35))
- Wir sollten dabei auch die Nutzung des US amerikanischen MITM Proxy Cloudflare nicht vergessen. ;)Empfehlung des Hauses: ([purelinux](https://social.tchncs.de/@purelinux/106030293067296833))
- Because of stupid admins using Cloudflare I'm unable to use Minifluxx to read their RSS feed ü§¨ ([lemming](https://chaos.social/@lemming/106093111435969969))
- You are not alone on that. When it happens to an anonymous user, legal recourse requires self-doxing, which is a shame. But non-anonymous victims of Cloudflare's blog spam should sue CF in small claims court, if they reside in a US state that has anti-spam laws. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106092842171085977))
- gets worse.Isn't ReclaimTheNetDotOrg a f$king Cloudflare site, also? ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106080932475511547))
- 45 office uses Cloudflare as well.For that matter NAS uses Cloudflare. ([mhjohnson](https://noagendasocial.com/@mhjohnson/106093164121290402))
- Mike Lindell is using CLOUDFLARE for his new "$10MM" FrankSpeech.comNow am I missing something here or is that crazy? ([commandlinekid](https://noagendasocial.com/@commandlinekid/106093139313455072))
- Very sad to learn that RIPE are now using Cloudflare. Yet another critical piece of infrastructure is under the control of a US company, and thus the US govt.I voiced my objection when I was asked for feedback and am told it is an emergency response to DDoS attacks, but they are considering keeping it in place. Cloudflare can now issue TLS certs on behalf of RIPE.Cloudflare can and do have outages, and the last one was ([dentangle](https://chaos.social/@dentangle/106029153024488971))
- Can someone give me an alternative to Cloudflare for DDoS protection? ([joerebelloharley](https://tilde.zone/@joerebelloharley/106018769569370126))
- If your website requires JavaScript or to fill out a CAPTCHA in order for me to view static text on an html page, you will not get my click-through. Also, fuck CloudFlare. All hail the waybackmachine! ([toiletpaper](https://shitposter.club/objects/3ff8caaf-0fe9-4f96-8d7b-bc253ffc1ea3))
- What‚Äôs this fuckery?So cloudflare takes it upon itself to censor websites now? (and of course it fucks it up)I can tell you with 100% certainty that these are not email addresses... ü§£ü§£ü§£ ([requiem](https://hackers.town/@requiem/106076888752929099))
- Hosted behind cloudflare... on AWS...we know how this will end.There is a playbook. ([thegibson](https://hackers.town/@thegibson/106065999743249062))
- I notice that both the UK labour and conservative parties are on cloudflare. This means that for example if you need to interact with those sites in order to become a member then that traffic will be intercepted and decrypted by a third party based in San Francisco, and very likely USG will have access to that. So for example this probably means that USG has a complete list of anyone who joined the Labour party during the Corbyn era. ([bob](https://epicyon.freedombone.net/@bob/106062964578845509))
- Looking up domain registration details for some organizations I know of, and being horrified that some of them are on cloudflare. In some cases that has non-trivial political implications. ([bob](https://epicyon.freedombone.net/@bob/106062927416983698))
- I didn‚Äôt exactly want to do it, but I needed to move OH.MG over to CloudFlare for some extra functionality I couldn‚Äôt recreate on my own. For the majority of the domain isn‚Äôt using the proxy, only 1 maybe 2 subdomains at most ([mmn](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@mmn/106037880862012606))
- Looks like Cloudflare nuked Disqus comments from their blog ([angristan](https://mstdn.io/@angristan/106020734058675983))
- Does change.org have Cloudflare? Didn‚Äôt know. Yeah, the problem with OpenPetiton is that I can‚Äôt reach as wide a mass of people than on Change. ([joerebelloharley](https://tilde.zone/@joerebelloharley/106018758584547570))
- just a heads up: LibreGit is a Cloudflare site. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106004641856311646))
- yikes- that EFF link redirects to a privacy-abusing Cloudflare site. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105997716676013916))
- Went into two restaurant+bars recently & was told "we have no paper menus due to COVID; use your phone to get the web menu". It's disturbing that a B&M business just assumes everyone has a smartphone & they're willing to marginalize those who do not. One of the bars outsourced to a site that outsourced to Cloudflare so the online menu discriminated further against Tor users. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106076523281386835))
- the company I'm working for decided to place the core products behinde cloudflare , the fight to avoid this was futile üòí now, months after this, new security concerns are popping up...unfortunately not from our "IT Security Manager" but from us: this "security" guy is pushing hard to install company wide qualys and zscaler üôà I'm really sick of this üí© Time to cut of with some wine in the weekend üç∑ and change thoughts! ([shinice](https://social.tchncs.de/@ShinIce/106075980593979334))
- IETF, the place where people turn to for open standards, RFC's, etc, has put itself in the exclusive walledGarden of Cloudflare. How utterly despicable. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106075330874815410))
- thanks, now I can confirm that CloudFlare really doesn't like Python urllib. I get an annoying 403 error. ([alexis](https://mas.to/@alexis/106073418808617107))
- Did you know, Cloudflare monopolises Fediverse dating instances.I'm sure they say it is to "protect" them. While also collecting lots of data that they can use later, you know, when the person finally learns things and wants to get into politics.winkpsyop mastodon bigData useTor useI2P ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106042400816418867))
- are you using cloudflare on your site getsession.org? Are you truly into privacy and security?;) ([br0m3x](https://social.weho.st/@Br0m3x/106030660157915833))

- So I‚Äôm still slowly undoing my connections to big data. One I‚Äôve grown accustomed to but need to change is Cloudflare. Any suggestions out there in the fediverse for managing domains and DNS settings? ([kvvpa](https://mastodon.social/@kvvpa/106020579499063416))
- Tor users who visit ACM via WaybackMachine get put in an endless direction loop when visiting to avoid Cloudflare ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106019323025090237))
- Cloudflare attacks Tor users, and that attack is ultimately an attack on privacy. But non-Tor users have it worse in a way, because they don't know when Cloudflare is seeing their traffic. They see the HTTPS padlock & think they have a safe connection, when actually Cloudflare sees their usernames, passwords, bank details, everything that goes to the Cloudflared website. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018962714167159))
- If you have to use Cloudflare for some reason, you can still allow Tor users to bypass the annoying challenge that usually comes up.Check "Firewall" - "Tools", and add an IP access rule for "Tor" with action "Allow". ([jhxy](https://fosstodon.org/@jhxy/106066472212870341))
- If need to check your IP address, is a nifty tool. It even has a JSON output: is hosted behind CloudFlare, so if you access it using curl via Tor, you get a CAPTCHA page.Hilariously, that page contains the IP address you reached the site from.

- the DNS is a separate matter than the reverse proxy. But that still sounds like bad advice. CloudFlare is not trustworthy and you wouldn't want them to be able to keep track of your DNS resolutions. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105923899340769618))
- Cloudflare wants to become the gatekeeper of the internet and control everything that wants to pass. Extensive monitoring of a profit driven company plus access for US intelligence.

- The election system is broken in terms of privacy.

- they've censored LGBT resources under sexual content with their DNS scheme, they harass tor users with captchas to access almost all their websites by default, which pins tracking information to you in an attempt to deanonymize you (Its s Google Captcha, what do you expect). They've consolidated a large part of the web and its traffic under their control and undermine the idea that encrypted web connections should be going directly to a site, untampered with.So if you're a large company with a stranglehold on internet traffic, the ability to track users, and view the unencrypted contents of their connections, what do you think is an obvious way to profit?Don't trust CloudFlare.

- Today first I successfully did a search on opensubtitles.org with Firefox and noticed that this site uses CloudFlare. Then later on I tried to do a search on opensubtitles.org with the Tor browser. I got the Google ReCaptcha, and after solving that for more than 10 to 15 times, where it seemed to give me access a few times, I was still not able to perform a search at all (meh) :_catsad: When will people realize that the free of charge for 1 website DDOS protection by CloudFlare is not at all a cool and free option to choose for. It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy. I hope that affordable CDN and DDOS protection alternatives will grow and vanish CloudFlare in the end. ([Ajz](https://mastodon.host/@Ajz))
- If you're at a small scale, why would you pretend you need the services that CloudFlare provides in the first place? I understand that people watching MSM and have little knowledge of IT will think that everyone in the world is constantly being DDoSed every time they make a post on their blog, but that's just not the case.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/0e1fe9a1-1099-4091-899b-69130f309a6e))
-  I understand the marketing team has a lot of other functionalities that you can list in order to make it look less bad, but you're still doing all your users a massive disservice by employing CloudFlare inbetween them and your service. No matter how many cool features you think you're getting for gratis, you're still handing all your customer data to them, essentially through having them become the middle man of the man in the middle scheme. Paying for that service is even more ridiculous from any sane perspective.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/e3a57b9a-a80d-4d2b-a44f-de8b166dba00))

- Cloudflare and Google captcha are the worst enemies of tor. ([lexa](https://mstdn.io/@lexa/103356277680824722))
- BTW, it doesn't matter who your CA is, the tunnel between outsiders & CF's site always terminates at CF.  So, for example, if you were a mastodon.social user, CF would see your username & unhashed pw full stop. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359038780017782))
- CloudFlare blocks from the reader's side, not the author.  If Alice blogs on a CF site then Bob is blocked from reading it if CF objects to Bob's IP address-browser pair.  And that's not theoretical -- it's certain. CF dictates who can reach who.  CF also pushes surveillanceCapitalism via a forced Google-served CAPTCHA (depending on IP-browser pair).  Using a CF service gives them power.  Twentyfivebux unwittingly supports centralization & empowers CF by using mastodon.social. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103358978513641848))
- Sure there are many instances.  Some are respecting of freedom & privacy, and some are not.  CloudFlare is an abuser of privacy & netneutrality.  You've specifically endorsed a CF node (mastodon.social). As a privacy foundation, you should know better and you should set a better example. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359630910309671))
-  CloudFlare sites like mastodon.social are profoundly stupid choices to endorse. Even if you neglect the Tor hostility & VPN weakness, CF still sees all traffic.  Also, using CF feeds a privacy abuser financially, which works against your alleged cause.  ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359717636003316))
- I'm more concerned with Clouflare's dominance (~75% of high-traffic websites on internet) regarding caching HTTPS in exchange for website owners private keys (in effect silently compromising  all visitors to said sites as well). After digging into Cloudbleed and the technical solution at Cloudflare making this security bug possible, along with their transparency  (www.cloudflare.com/transparency/), it became apparent that this is the biggest orchestrated HTTPS weakness out there serving US government.

- On a more serious note, I know a lot of people believe using Cloudflare automagically makes their site more secure because of the green lock indicating that fact. I can understand it more for people using crappy webhosts that you can't get certs from Let's Encrypt with. For people who run their own servers, there is no excuse for putting CF in the middle and giving them access to all their users' traffic. It's just stupid.

- Security: every site that uses it, Cloudflare is a proxy that intercepts all the traffic. It can therefore correlate individual user traffic across every site that uses/embeds cloudflare site/resources. Single point of security failure, from a global surveillance point of view. Usability: If you're a Tor user, it makes a huge part of the Internet unbearable because it constantly injects captchas to view sites every couple minutes, to block abuse.

- Everyone should boycott censorship-loving @Cloudflare and any groups associated with it that they are able. (Dailymotion) Cloudflare 8chan Censorship  ([Styx666Official](https://mstdn.foxfam.club/@Styx666Official/102570516495655146))
- I found that over half the sites I tried to visit would not load at all unless I added exceptions, and some loaded but with broken elements. It seems to me it's not healthy for the internet to have a single company controlling this much. They may be benevolent now, but what about the future? ([kezzbracey](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@kezzbracey/102574455814372037))
- Well done, Cloudflare. And thank you. Thank you for proving me right. You're a surveillance and censorship company. You start with nazis and you move on closer from that edge ([Dr. Roy](https://pleroma.site/objects/0f476d6e-aeef-4043-89c1-5db998b69497))
- And now bigTech cloudflare is deciding they need to be the gatekeeper of more speech. Because a crazy happened to post on one of their hosted sites??? ([poncho524](https://mastodon.host/@poncho524/102567778634669022))
- Ich betreibe gleich seit fast 14 Jahren eigene Server und hab noch keinen Grund daf√ºr finden k√∂nnen, sie komplett hinter einen Proxy von Cloudflare zu stellen. Ganz ehrlich... Wer Cloudflare wegen Sicherheit nimmt, der sollte aufgrund mangelnder Kenntnisse √ºber Serversicherheit seinen Server besser k√ºndigen und sich einfachen Webspace zu legen! ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102562981524139639))
- Services like CloudFlare are really nice with PatriotAct and NSA. USHackers whatawonderfulworld. CloudFlare create SSL certificates  for sites they cache. So have the wholme traffic unciphered locally, and send it to the remote server to be cached. So, they have clear and unciphered access to the whole content :  usernames   passwords  web content... ([popolon](https://mastodon.social/@popolon/102546838067285665))
- Google reCaptcha nicht erreichbar? ... Na dann viel Spa√ü in der H√∂lle, freunde von Cloudflare ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102543497886371728))
- the internet is a huge place even once you disable javascript and many websites stop working, and you use tor so the greatcloudwall auto-blocks you. ([jeffcliff](https://niu.moe/@jeffcliff/101894104472506869))
-  Ich surf inzwischen fast ausschlie√ülich √ºber TOR. Au√üer bei Betreibern, denen ic traue. Deswegen hab ich so oft √§rger mit CloudFlare. Nur wenige machen es z.B. wie nipos und deaktivieren den TOR Schutz. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102501955975549073))
- na klasse. Noch so eine deutsche Firma, die glaubt, der Datenschutz sei gew√§hrleistet, wenn man den kompletten Traffic durch einen proxy in den USA leitet. Also das Linux Magazin, nicht tuxedocomputers)
- Man k√∂nnte echt meinen, die deutschen k√∂nnten ohne Cloudflare nicht mehr leben  ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102501662983987631))
- This is a good example why it is bad to rely on cloudflare in masses. It felt like the internet was dying for a minute there. ([SolSoCoG](https://ieji.de/@SolSoCoG/102372262422393175))
- kann mir sicher beantworten, in wie weit Cloudflare mit dem deutschen Datenschutz vereinbar ist, wenn man eine Homepage hinter deren Proxy Server versteckt, deren Standorte in den USA liegen? Und wie muss Cloudflare in dem Fall in der Datenschutzerkl√§rung angegeben sein? ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102497051015883486))
- Wir haben also eine ‚Äûethical hacker‚Äú Zertifizierung von der NSA beworben und CloudFlare auf einer Seite. Was sagt uns das also √ºber CloudFlare aus? F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich sieht das so aus, als w√ºrde CloudFlare die Daten direkt zur NSA weiter leiten ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102462408957007477))
- Das Linux Magazin nennt die Nutzung der CloudFlare Reverse-Proxy Server als CDN ... Wenn das CDN ist, was ist dann das Ausliefern einzelner Dateien √ºber einen extra Server?)
- CloudFlare kann echt bald von jedem ein Bewegungsprofil erstellen, dagegen sind die Fahrzeuge von Google Maps ein schei√ü ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102475706977537396))
- Lustig, wie selbst INWX in ihren Datenschutzerkl√§rungen in keinster Weise CloudFlare erw√§hnt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102474883800543138))
- It's because cloudflare actively spies on traffic going through it, so any service connected to it is compromised by default. Even if the service itself is well-meaning and wants to respect privacy, just having cloudflare there ruins all of it. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102457243116505761))
- Cloudflare had a unchecked regex expression they rolled out to live service without testing and it broke half the Internet. ([Bluedepth](https://mastodon.technology/@Bluedepth/102457244936687401))
- Wenn ich mir die M√∂glichkeiten ansehe, die ich mit nginx habe, Log Dateien zu schreiben, l√§uft mir echt ein eiskalter Schauer √ºber den R√ºcken,weil ich mir ausmalen kann,welchen Preis Besucher von Webseiten hinter Cloudflare Proxy Servern bezahlen. Wenn ich das ganze dann hoch rechne...Die k√∂nnten ein komplettes bewegungsprofil eines jeden erstellen. Und Google wird durch das Captcha direkt mit gef√ºttert.)
- Ich als Anbieter k√∂nnte echt nicht mit dem Gewissen leben,meine Besucher so zu verkaufen ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102458133671163498))
- Mit Serverstandort Deutschland zu werben, nutzt einen schei√üdreck, wenn man den Server hinter den USA Proxys von CloudFlare versteckt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102457750251926436))
- Really disappointed and a little disgusted by the Matrix team. Putting Cloudflare spyware on their main instance, forcing every user to either go through the malicious wall or to use a homeserver that doesn't federate with matrix.org thus cutting itself off from just about everything. Will be giving XMPP a go today. Wonder if that community has even the tiniest bit of respect for users. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456355379841384))
- Even the main instance uses Cloudflare. New users will probably just use the main instance for convenience. ([RMW](https://linuxrocks.online/@RMW))
- I use to think it was cool that you can pay a little bit and have your own instance but it sucks that they put every instance behind Cloudflare. ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/101918685210269597))
- Don't laugh when cloudflare says ‚Äúthe network is the computer.‚Äù They mean surveillance and they mean the surveillance goes all the way to the endpoints. Boycott them and their nefarious agenda. ([roy](https://pleroma.site/objects/1ddf444d-0f2c-4d0d-bc11-e06f28efd5bc))
- I think I've found an alternative to Cloudflare Liberapay. I'm going to set Fosspay up this evening and start replacing Liberapay links on my website ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102436150784521976))
- I'm sad that the Crimeflare got deleted because they'd be having a field day today. cloudflare ([DashEquals](https://ap.torlipen.net/objects/5f1b65fc-499d-4312-b20e-7b0cb9dd7ee2))
- All I want is a privacy respecting messaging platform that does group conversations and voice chat, does that *really* have to be a big ask? Been really put off Matrix with the Cloudflare bullshit and their attitude towards it. There are whole papers on the issues with it. When will this fucking nightmare end? I need suggestions. What things do other people use for this stuff? ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456866393573493))
- Hi pixelfed! You just added a mandatory Cloudflare ajax service to pixelfed.social? The page is empty now... ([antonlopez](https://mastodon.social/@antonlopez/102451687366539901))
- Ich nutz haupts√§chlich Tor. Zwar heuchelt Cloudflare Tor-Freundlich zu sein, z.B. mit eigener Onion Adresse. Aber standardm√§√üig blocken die Tor Verbindungen, sofern man sie nicht freigibt.)
- Zudem empfinde ich es nicht gerade als Datenschutzfreundlich, die Cloudflare Proxy Server zu nutzen. Vor allem, da Cloudflare dem Patriot Act untersteht. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102440347862158580))
- au√üerdem empfinde ich pers√∂nlich es als Wohltuend, wenn die CloudFlare Fanboys mal genauso auf ein Forbidden sto√üen, wie TOR User all zu gern bei CloudFlare ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102447153687932571))
- I think that I will stop using it, until they remove it from Cloudflare. I don't see it as something that is made for privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare for their main instance. ([Robin](https://welovela.in/objects/456f3bba-ee24-48c5-92a3-7f80349dfbc3))
- angesprochen sollten auch nur jene werden, die keine Ahnung haben, aber dann so tun, als h√§tten sie sie. IT Blogger, die Anleitungen dazu bringen, wie man die Tor Exit Knoten Liste herunter l√§dt um die IP Adressen dann zu blockieren. Weil CloudFlare ja gesagt hat.)
- Und jene, die keine Ahnung haben ... denen ist die Meinung der wirklichen Experten schei√ü egal. Die lauschen lieber auf jene, die mit ihrem gef√§hrlichen Halbwissen das Internet verpesten. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102445550843368442))
- Hyperbola members who don't care about Cloudflare, which disrepect the privacy over violation of rule 3 of the social contract ([HarvettFox96](https://hostux.social/@HarvettFox96/102414243375270600))
- Remember how the liars at cloudflare pretended that had come under attack (causing major downtime), only later to admit that they broke their own service because they're technically incompetent. Avoid them. ([schestowitz](https://pleroma.site/objects/a5533839-4678-4c06-975f-5ceceeaa793d))
- is this instance using Cloudflare somehow? Was getting errors from it when trying to access Mstdn yesterday. ([orbifx](https://mstdn.io/@orbifx/102399186438337881))
- They use cloudflare for their Matrix.org and other servers they operate. ([eo](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@eo/102396215079147841))
- They talk about decentralization, while being behind cloudflare. awesome ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102387933088472002))
- It's been estimated that today's Cloudflare outage is effecting about 10% of all websites world-wide. If a lot of your online world is down right now, your word and research topic for the day is decentralization ([raye](https://sunbeam.city/@raye/102372447641525998))
- Seems like the world's biggest MiTM is down and took a rather large number of websites with it ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102372539142565301))
- So I guess Liberapay is behind TheGreatCloudwall now ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102207994379806531))

- Nat√ºrlich bezahlst du nichts, daf√ºr aber deine Besucher, die all ihre Daten und Metadaten einem in den USA durch den PatriotAct verpflichteten Dienst in den Rachen werfen. Noch dazu ein Dienst, der auf den meisten Seiten Tor blockiert. Fehler hin oder her ... Wer Datenschutz ernst nimmt, verzichtet auf Cloudflare und √§hnliche Dienste. Und wer doch einen Proxy vor seinem eigentlichen Dienst brauch, kann ihn ja selbst aufsetzen. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102372968538354130))

- they are too powerful, too big already. we dont' need to use them for time. ([jeffcliff](https://niu.moe/@jeffcliff/102310896326359164))
- cloudflare is proprietarysoftware. To matter matters even worse, it's centralised and attached to a political system which subjugates 100+ governments. ([schestowitz](https://pleroma.site/objects/ec8ac84d-60c2-4001-900a-85938c18abda))

- Ich wollte mal wieder bei LiberaPay vorbeischauen, dann springt mir cloudflare entgegen. PayPal, Stripe und nun Cloudflare. Ein einst vielversprechendes Projekt schafft sich selbst ab. ([kuketzblog](https://social.tchncs.de/@kuketzblog/102228512812286306))
- It makes it really hard for us Tor-users to use liberapay actually. We do know about Under Attack mode already, and I would like you to reconsider and not use cloudflare :) ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102208159022447946))
- What the fuck lowtechmagazine, you pull your fancy schmancy oh were all low-bandwith and solar powered, but then you're behind FUCKING Cloudflare, banning ips (not even a captcha). Where's the low tech solarpunk shit huh, liberal hippie garbage ([f0x](https://social.pixie.town/@f0x/102204802211287233))
- I'm pretty sure just throwing up your statically generated site on a random provider would be more energy efficient because it doesn't have to go through Cloudflare's surveillance apparatus. ([f0x](https://social.pixie.town/@f0x/102204938741162533))
- No deja de llamar la atencion, que la inmensa mayoria de las instancias del fediverso usen cloudflare, el PEOR enemigo de la privacidad y el anonimato. ¬øSabian que cloudflare considera a Tor una importante fuente de ataques DDoS, cuando no existen estudios que lo demuestren?
