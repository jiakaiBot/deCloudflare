It's pretty sad when even the hometown paper is behind the greatcloudwall.
C'mon guys. Stop using Cloudflare.
It's endangering the world wide web and you're blocking readers who are protecting
their privacy by using Tor.
```
-- [Mr. Jeff Cliff, BSc](https://shitposter.club/users/jeffcliff)


```
Man-in-the-middle attack is a serious offense.
If you′re using Cloudflare on your website, you won′t get first rank.
You shouldn′t use it if you value visitor′s privacy.
```
 -- [Searxes](https://ss.wodferndripvpe6ib4uz4rtngrnzichnirgn7t5x64gxcyroopbhsuqd.onion/)


```
There have been many cases of cloudflare denying people access to a website
without the website owner knowing.
I'm a legitimate user increasing my security by using a VPN but Cloudflare mistakenly
decides I'm a bot and denies access.
There have also been cases where Cloudflare just stops allowing anyone to visit a website
simply because they don't think anyone should be able to.

Regardless, that's not my main objection to Cloudflare.
As a "man in the middle", they get access to all of my traffic.
With the SSL certificates they provide, your connection is encrypted to Cloudflare then
decrypted and sent to the server. The lock icon in your browser means absolutely nothing
when a third party is literally getting *all* of your traffic when you connect to that site.
Beyond that, with so many sites using Cloudflare, cross-site tracking becomes a problem.

In addition, with so many websites behind Cloudflare, when it goes down, half the web is down.
The internet was designed to be decentralised and Cloudflare is centralising it.
Half of the internet relying on a single entity is dangerous.
```
-- [Amolith, Ex contributor](https://social.nixnet.services/@Amolith)


```
Think about your visitors.
Do you like it when websites ruin a bit of your experience?
In other words: Would you love to visit a website which forces you
to solve a annoying timewasting puzzle usually after waiting five
seconds which also cost you valuable time?
Awesome! Use Cloudflare!
```
-- [Robin Wils](https://linuxrocks.online/@RMW)

```
I say it's a bad idea to pimp CloudFlare sites and expect such repressions to go unchallenged.
Activism is a duty & ethics trumps netiquette.
```

"Was mitunter daran liegt, dass Cloudflare die Funktion nicht nicht klar genug definiert und natürlich, dass jedes scheiß Medium TOR Kriminalisiert. Klar, man kann da Drogen, Waffen, ... kaufen, aber das kann ich fast an jedem Bahnhof auch ... Kriminalisieren wir deswegen gleich die Deutsche Bahn?" by [kromonos](https://social.snopyta.org/@kromonos/104422729452085600)

"Manche schieben meinen Groll gegen Cloudflare direkt auf die Privatsphäre ... Aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil. Z.B. finde ich es kritischer, dass das SSL Zertifikat von denen terminiert wird. Was mich aber am meisten an Cloudflare nervt ist deren Politik gegenüber TOR Benutzer. Toll, sie haben eine eigene .onion Adresse ... Aber dass jeder TOR Benutzer direkt mit einem Captcha maltretiert wird, ist bei denen Standardmäßig aktiv ... Und kaum jemand macht sich die Mühe das um zu stellen." by [kromonos](https://social.snopyta.org/@kromonos/104422723256179082)

"Banks have a standard level of security. It's not as high as it should be but it's well above CloudFlare.

"I think I've only ever encountered one bank foolish enough to use CloudFlare. Liberapay, Patreon, & openCollective all expect donors to set aside ethics and make a charitable donation, one that gives their financial data to web's most notorious privacy & netneutrality abuser. Of course it's reckless." by [aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/104417691192513186)

""CF also allows website admins.." It's CloudFlare's default setting that has put them in a position of abusing privacy & netneutrality.

"CloudFlare also pushes Google reCAPTCHA, from which further privacy abuse arises.

"I never made the claim that the US gov. has CloudFlare's view of the data, so I have no need to substantiate the US role.

"CloudFlare & Sucuri would share the MitM problem but not abuses to netneutrality, tor hostility, support for Google snooping, centralization of over 10% of the web, lying in their blog (telling users trust is not needed for CF service), blocking US voters from registering ( votersuppression), dictating web browsers to users (attacking text-based browsers) & yes- being shitbags." by [aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/104416035343972148)

"It also would not make sense to evaluate the serverfarm that a website connects to since most of the traffic is between CloudFlare & the visitors, not website-to-CF. The vistors can come from anywhere, so you'd have to work out the percentage of unclean serverfarms under CF's control.

"CloudFlare is inherently energy wastefull. Bots & humans who use text-based browsers are the most environmentally respectful b/c they do not tend to download images (which consumes far more bandwidth than text). When images are not downloaded, CF's Google CAPTCHA automatically treats the connection like a hostile bot, & actually pushes images to an otherwise very green session," by [resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/104413504524131828)

"Fdroid's service is essential but they do not lead by good example. is narrowly focused on freesoftware w/out regard to important freedoms outside that context.

"the snowdrift.coop page has a lot more options than I was aware of, & it reminded of the CloudFlare site I couldn't think of earlier: openCollective. It would be an embarrassment for any privacy-focused project to use CloudFlare, & for me it would be sufficient to question project motives.

"Gitlab.com is indeed google-hosted & proxied via CloudFlare. It goes against the values of the Tor community.

"The election system is broken in terms of privacy.

I got the Google ReCaptcha, and after solving that for more than 10 to 15 times, where it seemed to give me access a few times, I was still not able to perform a search at all (meh) :_catsad: When will people realize that the "free of charge" for 1 website DDOS protection by #CloudFlare is not at all a cool and "free" option to choose for. It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy.

"kann mir sicher beantworten, in wie weit #Cloudflare mit dem deutschen #Datenschutz vereinbar ist, wenn man eine #Homepage hinter deren #Proxy Server versteckt, deren Standorte in den #USA liegen? Und wie muss Cloudflare in dem Fall in der #Datenschutzerklärung angegeben sein?" by @[kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102497051015883486)

"Wir haben also eine „ethical hacker“ #Zertifizierung von der #NSA beworben und CloudFlare auf einer Seite. Was sagt uns das also über #CloudFlare aus?

"Really disappointed and a little disgusted by the #Matrix team. Putting #Cloudflare spyware on their main instance, forcing every user to either go through the malicious wall or to use a homeserver that doesn't federate with matrix.org thus cutting itself off from just about everything. Will be giving #XMPP a go today. Wonder if that community has even the tiniest bit of respect for users." by @[OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456355379841384)

"angesprochen sollten auch nur jene werden, die keine Ahnung haben, aber dann so tun, als hätten sie sie. IT Blogger, die Anleitungen dazu bringen, wie man die #Tor Exit Knoten Liste herunter lädt um die IP Adressen dann zu blockieren. Weil #CloudFlare ja gesagt hat.
Und jene, die keine Ahnung haben ... denen ist die Meinung der wirklichen Experten scheiß egal. Die lauschen lieber auf jene, die mit ihrem gefährlichen Halbwissen das Internet verpesten." by @[kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102445550843368442)
