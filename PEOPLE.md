> It's pretty sad when even the hometown paper is behind the greatcloudwall.
> C'mon guys. Stop using Cloudflare.
> It's endangering the world wide web and you're blocking readers who are protecting their privacy by using Tor.

> Man-in-the-middle attack is a serious offense.
> If you‚Ä≤re using Cloudflare on your website, you won‚Ä≤t get first rank.
> You shouldn‚Ä≤t use it if you value visitor‚Ä≤s privacy.

> I say it's a bad idea to pimp CloudFlare sites and expect such repressions to go unchallenged.
> Activism is a duty & ethics trumps netiquette.
> Posting original information exclusively on onion sites is like affirmative action for the repressed Tor community.
> Correcting the wrongs of CloudFlare entails some unfair discrimination against clearnet users.
