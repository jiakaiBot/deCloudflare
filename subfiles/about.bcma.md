This add-on will block, notify, or redirect your request if the target website is using Cloudflare.

The purpose of this browser add-on is to block Cloudflare sites.

The TLS protocol promises end-to-end encryption between the client and an authenticated, identified endpoint server. The browserâ€™s lock icon is a UI widget which makes this promise to the user. Cloudflare is a mass-decryption chokepoint, which intercepts and decrypts the Web requests made by billions of people to millions of websites.
 
This add-on never send any data.
Your cloudflare-domain collection is yours.
