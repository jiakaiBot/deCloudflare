# Ss (Serĉi)


![](../image/ss-sercxi.png)


**Ss** (other name is "_Sercxi_", the word _Search_ in [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto)), previously called _[Searxes](https://web.archive.org/web/20210614033612/https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Searx&oldid=906373508)_, is a search engine website for [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) users.
Some people think Ss is [Schutzstaffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS) but do not get confused; the second letter s is lowercase taken from _Searxe**s**_.

It is fed by quality sources and rank down CloudFlare sites to bottom, thus you avoid the risk and inconvenience of having [MitM traps](../README.md) littered throughout search results.
You can also open a cached version of the page by clicking the favicon of the search result.
There are many options to play with, for example disabling Cloudflare ranking and rank down known Tor-hostile sites.

The current Ss logo resembles an umbrella. Developers said that they want to provide an _umbrella_ to stay safe from heavy _rain_ from the _cloud_.
