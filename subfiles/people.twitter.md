- when Cloudflare shows a capture screen before the site opens it seems to stop mobile Metamask working through the browser. When it doesn't show the wallet works. ([robert53646087](https://twitter.com/Robert53646087/status/1467074506728644609))
- Because if they just decided 'fuck cloudflare' and null routed it, that's hilarious ([da_667](https://twitter.com/da_667/status/1466842589009788932))
- 7) With respect to Cloudflare - there is 2FA. How the fuck did the hacker get access to an admin API key to inject their own javascript when should have had 2FA setup and if 2FA was setup, how did this hacker gain access? I am baffled. ([convexical](https://twitter.com/convexical/status/1466689338301980672))
- 5) Eventually the hacker had enough accounts to go after - and decided to execute their attack. 6) Regardless of the outcome - a lot still doesn't make sense. How the fuck does a hacker get access to a website's Cloudflare global CDN API key in the first place? :( ([convexical](https://twitter.com/convexical/status/1466684551158280192))
- Is there any ETA for a fix that will stop this issue for good? I just woke up right now to a outage at my work because Vercel decided to block Cloudflare's traffic once again. For almost a year now I've been hearing from Vercel that this issue is being worked on. cc Matthew ([arunesh90](https://twitter.com/arunesh90/status/1466690115317678083))
- But in Web2 you can call Cloudflare and tell them to stop hosting cyberbullying sites like Kiwifarms and if you're lucky they'll refuse to provide DDoS services, or domain hosting (presuming that Cloudflare gives a damn about trans people being bullied to suicide) ([yesiwebto](https://twitter.com/yesiwebto/status/1466572135346819072))
- There was minimal load on the server side and seems that Cloudflare blocked bunch of users Going forward, we'll reduce the sensitivity settings for Cloudflare The upcoming challenges will take more time & be a bit more complex to make it more enjoyable for everyone ([grayfox48259818](https://twitter.com/GrayFox48259818/status/1466570849616547841))
- I keep thinking that CloudFlare is some kind of a weird human subject experiment on Tor users, like how many can be tricked into enabling JS. ([hackerb0t](https://twitter.com/hackerb0t/status/1466452403591565320))
- Welcome Cloudflare to IndexNow! Their Crawler Hints service now supports IndexNow, a new protocol by Bing and that allows websites to notify Search engines whenever content on their website content is created, updated, or deleted. ([jordirib1](https://twitter.com/JordiRib1/status/1466434489219960838))
- Just thought you should know that your Firewall is causing intermittent connectivity issues. I've had a Cloudflare page appear twice with error messages about ports being monitored for attacks. I promise that I'm not a hacker... I just want to buy X-mas presents ü§£ ([jaded_epilogue](https://twitter.com/Jaded_Epilogue/status/1466299319850467335))
- Probably they are using TOR browser. If you are using cloudflare, you can just block TOR browser and all gone. ([turgayyilmaz](https://twitter.com/turgayyilmaz/status/1466130952065884168))
- This. Having a way to pass the captcha details to an api and being able to verify it would be huge. ([htr_xorth](https://twitter.com/htr_xorth/status/1466088471504773124))
- Worst NFT Drop I've ever seen. Poorly set up Cloudflare, Italy and Ukraine users are accessing website VPN, I suppose some other countries affected as well. Considering the hype the website load should have been tested. Thousand updates and not tested NFT minting. No wordsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ([btcvld](https://twitter.com/btcvld/status/1466010587876442112))
- hey i just got a new pc. How do i download the launcher when blocked by cloudflare stuff ([cj_8295](https://twitter.com/CJ_8295/status/1465871286018711555))
- It doesn't matter, if you have 30 different connections coming from one VPN server, it's literally the same thing as if you used your own IP in the first place. They just block simultaneous connections from a single IP. Services like Cloudflare do it all the time to prevent DDOS. ([c4m0o](https://twitter.com/c4m0o/status/1465800029168361474))
- 8080 = redirect 8443 = Error 522 "Connection timed out", "You": "Browser":"Working" , "Tokyo": "Cloudflare":"Working" , "Host":"Error" ([taiki_desuyo](https://twitter.com/Taiki_desuyo/status/1465570481960931330))
- site dead = contract dead = ethereum down don't you get it? please turn on cloudflare for ethereum and stop these ddosers can the devs do something?!?!?! ([paymentloop](https://twitter.com/PaymentLoop/status/1465487590598103041))
- There's a classic interface you can change to, that was giving me a cloudflare error but now it's working for the moment. ([justinmoore_747](https://twitter.com/JustinMoore_747/status/1465482067467071492))
- for the past month or so cloudflare's been fucking with my ffn links, and I can't figure out how to stop it. It's seriously annoying. üò§ ([crischalcedony](https://twitter.com/CrisChalcedony/status/1462924909026316292))
- Hello! We are seeing the 522 error Intermittently, sometimes content on our sites is presented, other times it is not. We‚Äôve made no changes and bypassing cloudflare presents us with out content. Any ideas? ([sirideeeeee](https://twitter.com/sirideeeeee/status/1465283486646951938))
- You‚Äôre also blocking my bank messages‚Ä¶and I don‚Äôt know who you are and how you found my data?? ([figvilleusa](https://twitter.com/FigVilleUSA/status/1463283713358266371))
- Can't stop checking my site to see if it's working. Had to completely remove all Cloudflare and CDN just so I can point it to my new host without errors. ([thekathyava](https://twitter.com/thekathyava/status/1464452852969922567))
- Seems you got blacklisted by Cloudflare. I know a few ip addresses got blocked for spam yesterday. If you dm me last 3 numbers of IP i can check/unblock. ([chrtrio](https://twitter.com/chrtrio/status/1462980728501768197))
- Why don't you guys suggest a country that the VPN would work ([theodorelallen](https://twitter.com/TheodoreLAllen/status/1463563069792083972))
- Getting a cloudflare error when I try and access from my hotspot, any ideas? ([nathanlfc1996](https://twitter.com/NathanLFC1996/status/1464607808687591431))
- Just tested and it works fine for me. Are you still seeing the error? Can you DM me a screenshot with some details? ([yank](https://twitter.com/Yank/status/1463346274254528519))
- .endlessfluff .swellanimations There were more common and vice versa. Would be able to use cloudflare. ([averagebotfan](https://twitter.com/AverageBotFan/status/1465438702172352525))
- Unable to access Gun broker‚Äôs website. Constant 502 bad gateway error. This has been happening for over an hour! ([2tired_2care](https://twitter.com/2tired_2care/status/1460065088786911235))
- Cloudflare is blocking my requests (Browser, Postman, Python requests library). Any idea how to get around that? ([brianalexand_r](https://twitter.com/brianalexand_r/status/1464856659210080257))
- Yes, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case. After I blocked the source IP address on CloudFlare, the requests have stopped. ([debsuryorg](https://twitter.com/debsuryorg/status/1464678282738155535))
- Even though I deactivated and deleted my site off of cloudflare, I keep getting an error when I activate the CDN with my new host. They had me contact cloudflare to remove any old DNS settings - still waiting ([thekathyava](https://twitter.com/thekathyava/status/1464636733300039681))
- I'm getting errors trying to log into your website on multiple browsers, are there any issues on your end? Error says everything is fine up until it tries to connect to your website. Browser and Cloudflare is fine but the Host is giving me errors. ([xmarsipan](https://twitter.com/xMarsipan/status/1464627241271402505))
- I can't actually read the article, because I'm blocked by Cloudflare. ü§∑üèª ([termycornall](https://twitter.com/TermyCornall/status/1464582270971351040))
- The ultimate error is "Firefox can‚Äôt establish a connection to the server at ([itsjohannawren](https://twitter.com/ItsJohannaWren/status/1464466461682855947))
- This is what happens when a server outage happens to NFTs... Or someone unplugs the wrong fucking box They are not secure. These millions of $$ spent on NFTs are currently hosted with single points of failure, whether they tell you that or not. Waiting for "but cloudflare" lol ([escape1979uk](https://twitter.com/escape1979uk/status/1464385684697980928))
- Momentan keine bestellung m√∂glich - Cloudflare error ..... Was ist da los? ([mrgan_matej](https://twitter.com/mrgan_matej/status/1464259411095044096))
- Website is as bad as US mint for Black Friday sales. I had two doorbusters in my cart and it crashed, internal server error, cloudflare errors, etc. Really disappointed to lose these. ([pquaglia](https://twitter.com/pquaglia/status/1464221090692190210))
- to know how the fuck are white house and the like. The thing is that is recording to cloudflare. ([averagebotfan](https://twitter.com/AverageBotFan/status/1464170292264292366))

- The only way I can get on website is if I click on link on you guys Twitter account. If I try to connect to website any other way I get that error message. I am only having this problem with your website. Right now not a issue for me, but I can't be the only one that had problem. ([theodorelallen](https://twitter.com/TheodoreLAllen/status/1463758791816712200))
- In my case if i give any special characters like /, its blocking it ...Is there any tips for it ([menakche](https://twitter.com/menakche/status/1463735419242102787))
- Okie dokie everyone the website update will be put on hold and in the meantime I will be uploading the film to my YouTube channel you may ask why is that? the DDOS attacks are still going on against my website cloudflare is blocking it but I don't want to chance it Stay tuned ([jkileyofficial](https://twitter.com/JKileyOfficial/status/1463429406190452739))
- We are creating a DNS daemon that supports ICANN domains & our TLD offerings, & compensates nodes in $DWEB. We plan on taking this solution to major DNS providers like GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Google, ISPs, etc. We have blocked .eth and other TLDs offered so there are no conflicts. ([decentra_web](https://twitter.com/decentra_web/status/1463282208433528834))
- Hey guys, the minting site has been down for about an hour - some issue with the Cloudflare gateway (error 502). Not sure if this is just affecting me? Could be too much traffic? ([westleyavenue](https://twitter.com/westleyavenue/status/1463268467516182530))
- I meant to say screenshot of the error. But I found it on google, have you tried changing your router DNS settings to use Google or CloudFlare? ([mirasynth](https://twitter.com/mirasynth/status/1463252846263123970))
- opensea is as broken as I've ever seen it rn the floor option just returns random items and 'cloudflare' error is occuring regular these fckers got $100m funding in June, VC backed, and executing fcking HORRIBLY coinbase will kill em ([bastardghosts](https://twitter.com/BastardGhosts/status/1463195624673796104))
- Our business Kens Auto Spares is being blocked by CloudFlare Family DNS service. Lots of our customers are complaining that they can't access our website and its losing us business! Remove us - our site is safe!! ([kens_auto_spare](https://twitter.com/Kens_Auto_Spare/status/1463162626112950280))
- My thought process was: If they let you configure this in the STS settings, it could confuse users if it can be overwritten (vice/versa) in the Transform Rules. That said, error could be clearer if that is the case. ([seanhood](https://twitter.com/SeanHood/status/1463091206813016066))
- Did I tell you all advertise having an error rate of 20-25%...I'm guessing you're missing and humbling imo. It was a cloudflare. ([averagebotfan](https://twitter.com/AverageBotFan/status/1463010372475133953))
- 3:59 PM You sent I am visiting the UK from the USA and I cannot access the site I get Access denied Error 1020 which I believe is a cloudflare issue. How can I resolve this? I need to pay my premium. ([ionedev](https://twitter.com/ionedev/status/1462813417971105801))
- Paranoia, apparently, combined with a concern that Cloudflare is a massive man in the middle. (The counterpoint to that: Cloudflare also makes websites more accessible.) There is also a concern that it shuts some people out of certain websites based on their global location. ([shortformernie](https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/1462829492758528001))
- Mastodon is a competing social network that is OSS. There is a contingent on Cloudflare that has raised some weird privacy issues about the service and are trying to pitch the idea that it‚Äôs a massive MITM project that censors the internet ([shortformernie](https://twitter.com/ShortFormErnie/status/1462807855552241665))
- One of my friends tried it, CloudFlare banned his IP so he could no longer access things as well as he got captcha on every site. So it's not practical for home users. ([_alirezaaa](https://twitter.com/_Alirezaaa/status/1462517777173041157))

- omg, amazing again, you just don't stop üòÇ ([leomp1208](https://twitter.com/leomp1208/status/1461341575846395910))
- I'm finding more and more sites that block access from non-ISP IP addresses or that use CloudFlare who block 'troublesome' addresses which is are problems when using any VPN service - I'm concerned that as this becomes more widespread the internet will become less private. ([dilbertdave](https://twitter.com/DilbertDave/status/1461757268345643014))
- Not to alarm you but if the Cloudflare captcha is happening a lot you might have a virus on your computer, this was happening to me but then I reformatted my hard drive and it stopped happening ([morgankbell](https://twitter.com/morgankbell/status/1461745131220979712))
- Dear if you must bind your website to tracking beacons on cloudflare, then design your services so they don't break when schools filter out the tracking. Better yet, since you are marketing to schools, with minors accessing your content, stop this tracking. ([jefflouwmuse](https://twitter.com/JeffLouwMuse/status/1461688517185187842))
- They do use Cloudflare. Maybe the crawler was blocked by CF and CF uses dotnet? ([kwaazaar](https://twitter.com/kwaazaar/status/1461639163380445186))
- Oops, I guess we weren't so genius... Gateway time-out The web server reported a gateway time-out error. Ray ID: 6b05f05dca45c64f Your IP address: redacted Error reference number: 504 Cloudflare Location: Minneapolis ([csrowell](https://twitter.com/csrowell/status/1461518980053618691))
- There‚Äôs vastly more people around the globe using their free tier for their CDN etc. than paying customers. Its not conspiratorial its common sense; make a global online service where you handle traffic (MITM) & is so alluring that it gets adopted in every country. ([ashleycawley](https://twitter.com/ashleycawley/status/1461102539366178819))
- It‚Äôs not blocked, it‚Äôs rate limited. But if I did block it then yeah, CF would need to store that! ([troyhunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1461452265793810434))
- It‚Äôs quite hard to do anything when you have blocked ALL image traffic. Even our own logo is replaced with a cloudflare abuse image when we ‚Äúorange cloud‚Äù our traffic‚Ä¶ so yes the service is very much impacted ([ryanseanbadger](https://twitter.com/ryanseanbadger/status/1461199487871840258))
- And the fact Cloudflare has been allowed to front crazy Jihadi sites etc is proof enough in my book that they're used as an NSA MiTM. ([penfolddavid](https://twitter.com/PenfoldDavid/status/1461327361224450051))
- Hi , I have updated your page too many times and my IP got blocked by cloudflare. Do you plan to handle that better in the future? Unfortunately, that's why I couldn't buy any flat punks. üòü ([_bitcoin_pirate](https://twitter.com/_Bitcoin_Pirate/status/1461252401864794116))
- Bhai plz koi bata do why tf did cloudflare stop working im legit pissed ([spraykingthe1](https://twitter.com/spraykingthe1/status/1461190897442295814))
- This is impressive, even more because it's all logged. it's not like they blocked directly on XDP (maybe only if they are just l3/l4) but these logs are about L7, Right? cloudflare and clickhouse rocks! ([renatocron](https://twitter.com/renatocron/status/1461117558455734278))
- It essentially makes them a man in the middle, they're able to decrypt & see the traffic flow in plaint-text, they establish another SSL connection to the origin web-server. Say theoretically it was NSA sponsored it'd be the perfect man-in-the-middle point would it not? ([ashleycawley](https://twitter.com/ashleycawley/status/1461084808436715523))
- What mechanism? As you say, they systematically MiTM your traffic. What better way to circumvent the advent of ubiquitous transport security? ([penfolddavid](https://twitter.com/PenfoldDavid/status/1461086118259138564))
- Dear your LNURL endpoint doesn't seem to like requests over Tor :( Cloudflare much? üò≠ ([lightningtipb0t](https://twitter.com/LightningTipB0t/status/1461048766425935878))

- Some of our team have spent the morning upgrading our infrastructure to better block attacks to our client's sites. A great example is XML RPC attacks, now getting blocked straight away on the server firewall and in Cloudflare. wordpress sysadmin devops ([vatu](https://twitter.com/vatu/status/1460960225075335170))
- Lol, a government blocking illegal things... ([electrospaces](https://twitter.com/electrospaces/status/1459902691505754113))
- Discord, Spotify and Snapchat are having a fucking bruh moment (probably cloudflare again lol) ([lunaforeverr](https://twitter.com/LunaForeverr/status/1460667714419240969))
- site cant load keep getting cloudflare error ([westie_will](https://twitter.com/westie_will/status/1460970134852485125))

- Cloudflare went down. "CloudFlare is becoming a huge single point of failure for the Internet." reddit post deleted though ([s1lverfox](https://twitter.com/s1lverFoX/status/1460697380135882752))
- It seems like the attackers have moved from Telnyx to Iristel. This won't stop till everyone is behind CloudFlare. ([dovid](https://twitter.com/Dovid/status/1460400835297517569))
- can you please turn off the captcha cloudflare check for your website PLEASE!!!! It doesn't work correctly, and I have to try the stupid thing 50 times before it lets me in ([ignat980](https://twitter.com/Ignat980/status/1460715902899474436))
- Long story, but Cloudflare was blocking legitimate traffic with significant implications. ([mragucci](https://twitter.com/mragucci/status/1460696503136182283))
- I wish that Cloudflare documentation would not be such a pita to read. For example, what do the different sensitivity levels "high", "medium" and "low" mean for the managed ruleset (eg HTTP error rate is above the sensitivity level)???? Or why does CF ignore HTTP 429 responses? ([rainbowderpyyay](https://twitter.com/RainbowDerpyYaY/status/1460671862380322817))
- No they dont. This is normal that it shows google because of their dns setup. If the dns service (for example cloudflare) cant find the host, it shows google dns error or google page by default ([2tapprince](https://twitter.com/2TapPrince/status/1460671515368820743))
- cloudflare down again we should stop using big website that use cloudflare ([the_oio](https://twitter.com/The_oio/status/1460667924616777737))

- It‚Äôs redirecting every image on our host to your blocked page. ([ryanseanbadger](https://twitter.com/ryanseanbadger/status/1460602649036738560))
- Could well be. Cultaholic uses Cloudflare so Error 523 would be traffic (or the server crashed) but in general, a Error 500 would be a PHP error and since Cultaholic uses WordPress, it's more than likely a plugin or theme. (Generally the former) ([padraigfahy](https://twitter.com/PadraigFahy/status/1460545369931198465))
- Hi. Please refresh thebpage and carry on as normal. This is a CloudFlare warning that simply states there was a temp error connecting. But a simple refresh should resolve this ([zap_splat](https://twitter.com/zap_splat/status/1460399206720585729))
- Any idea what's going on there? Site's been inaccessible for about a week, now. Is Cloudflare blocking our access? ([frankpa88333108](https://twitter.com/FrankPa88333108/status/1460335696238026763))
- yeah, the cloudflare links throws either a 524 or 429 error ([platocrat](https://twitter.com/platocrat/status/1460337384248152067))

- 1/2 you don‚Äôt need an enterprise subscription to submit a bot to be verified. the list is for bot owners whose automated calls are getting blocked by our BM systems (and is traffic our users typically want to reach their applications). if your calls are being blocked by sites ([prdonahue](https://twitter.com/prdonahue/status/1460106273916080132))
- that's a specific flag for use within firewall rules, but the verified bot list works automatically in super bot fight mode (non-enterprise). can you open a support ticket with details/reproducible error and DM me the ticket ? ([prdonahue](https://twitter.com/prdonahue/status/1460107443023851523))
- Sounds good - right now if I try to use the blogging stuff it freezes for like 5 minutes then gives me a cloudflare error.... :( ([markymarg2](https://twitter.com/MarkyMarg2/status/1458222729459486724))

- You can profit off of providing a decentralized & open platform, that was pretty damn tricky (if not outright impossible) with the old ways. 2 - You don't own domains nowadays. ICANN, or IP giants like CloudFlare, can censor you if they choose to. ([siredspace](https://twitter.com/SiredSpace/status/1458271650101739522))
- Et les performances du site aussi :/ C'est blind√© de captcha cloudflare partout, la session qui se d√©connecte en moins de 10 minutes etc ...

- i just really really wish there were some way--without giving all my information to fucking Google--to access websites from random IP addresses. I get I egress from some funky locations. Blockades on IP addresses and the centralization of Cloud is damaging the internet. ([neilhanlon](https://twitter.com/NeilHanlon/status/1457874621718532101))
- Step 1 doesn't guarantee that platform operators will respect your data, privacy, and freedom Like, cool, "internet access is a human right", nice... But what about ICANN? What about Cloudflare? Do they suddenly stop their giant control of "internet property" distribution? ([siredspace](https://twitter.com/SiredSpace/status/1458470099346731008))

- Well I tracked him back to Sophia Bulgaria where he had hacked into one of Cloudflare's servers. Filed a local PD report, an FBI IC3, & notified Cloudflare's Admin folks. Spoke with the Spec.

- Wow Cloudflare seems to have pissed itself, and I can't even reliably check to see if it is a cloudflare issue or an ISP deciding "Fuck Cloudflare today" issue because a lot of the sites that check stability status run on Cloudflare themselves. What a joke ([pokemongod777](https://twitter.com/PokemonGod777/status/1458303582332198912))
- If there was a way to anycast address a cjdns IP or an onion address at a cloudflare level of scale (not just Enterprise onion toolkit), for an API endpoint (content can be torrented) that'd be awesome.

- Though they are totally awesome, could make a feature to allow us to upload bind9 formatted zones for the DNS. Domains only has bind9 export, not import.

- That's essentially what it's doing now. It makes sense to test on import (I'd have designed it the same way)... the issue is the misleading error.

At the moment, it just assumes crypto isn't valid because the function fails - but doesn't actually tell you the real reason. Cheers! ([paul_reviews](https://twitter.com/Paul_Reviews/status/1450103224875298824))
- Support have no idea what they are on about. That's a CloudFlare firewall block to reduce malicious attacks, your IP address has triggered one of the filters and you've been blocked. If you have a dynamic IP then change your IP, use a different IP or instead use a VPN or proxy ([reubenrs3](https://twitter.com/ReubenRS3/status/1450101737893728258))
- Well, it's fixed... and you'll never guess how I fixed it! Moved the import line from global to onFetch, so it only invokes the test code during an actual request. If you try to test the same code at any other time, CF throws a "some operations can only be called... " error! ([paul_reviews](https://twitter.com/Paul_Reviews/status/1450073873072930822))

- Sqlmap is a bad choice. 1 if only 1 ip blocking firewall kicks you your banned from all sites that uses that firewall ( cloudflare, akamai ) and sqlmap can't see the difference between blocked or bot blocked.

- it does not change the fact that mozilla has made deals to funnel DNS traffic to cloudflare, and that they have started to operate VPN grifting operations.

- From the user's perspective, is it acceptable to have "you allow Cloudflare to MITM most of your traffic, or no (most of the) internet for you"? ([nexusukorg](https://twitter.com/NexusUKOrg/status/1448201603757092869))
- I'm specifically talking about a situation where the user has authorised the MITM at their end. And if you think the average website owner has any more idea about the internals of Cloudflare than the average user has about a middlebox they have authorised... well :) ([nexusukorg](https://twitter.com/NexusUKOrg/status/1448201325695709185))
- The big difference - to me - is that the content producer has trusted cloudflare as a supplier and knows and expects their traffic to be treated that way. The end user hasn‚Äôt agreed to - and doesn‚Äôt have knowledge of - MITM type equipment that may be intercepting them. ([rsmck](https://twitter.com/rsmck/status/1448199105650507782))
- I'm afraid I still find the lack of consultation pretty troubling. And separately, cloudflare's position on MITM proxies is very hypocritical. ([nexusukorg](https://twitter.com/NexusUKOrg/status/1448187859022778368))

- Check your DNS Settings. A 523 error means that Cloudflare could not reach your host web server. The most common cause is that your DNS settings are incorrect. ([bottledsodas](https://twitter.com/BottledSodas/status/1448207287537995776))
- I consider Cloudflare to be pretty hypocritical on the subject of MITM - they themselves are a MITM proxy working on behalf of the content supplier, but are dead set against MITM proxies working on behalf of the content consumer.

- The only way to be "so certain, so fast" that "there was no malicious activity behind this outage" is if no human was involved anywhere.

Bilder laden teilweise nicht, Videos dann wiederum schon. Ganz kurios. ([bibloki](https://twitter.com/bibloki/status/1239330948229062664))
- I think it‚Äôs mostly due to TLS 1.0 and 1.1 using weaker encryption algorithms, easier for man in the middle attacks and stuff, the server itself isn‚Äôt put at risk as much as the end user is but attackers could still do wild stuff if they find a way to spoof as a privileged user ([rgriesemer3](https://twitter.com/rgriesemer3/status/1223651306516205575))

- The issue probably stemmed from a misconfiguration of Facebook's servers, which didn't let users connect to its sites. The problem was compounded when apps (and users) got error messages and kept trying to reconnect, sparking a "tsunami" of traffic, according to Cloudflare‚Ä¶ ([telebusiness](https://twitter.com/telebusiness/status/1445322175083388936))
- Yes, very helpful. Look forward to learning what happened within FB. Odds are human error rather than human malice.

- What? BGP routes for facebook being deleted has nothing to do with you being offline (or any AI censoring people).

- I've read from Cloudflare that they have effectively deleted themselves off the Internet by removing all BGP peering and/or routes. Self-hosted DNS with no way to reach it will cause that. ([stoobert](https://twitter.com/Stoobert/status/1445129392674549766))

- yeah. it's a useful feature if your ISP's DNS servers are untrustworthy and you don't know of any good, fast alternatives. but why the fuck did they default it to CloudFlare of all places :-/ ([cybercrimemlm](https://twitter.com/cybercrimemlm/status/1442679902944342018))

- Don't play the victim card here because anyone with an IQ of a rock saw this coming from a mile away. Also, if you look up your own domain, the two points of contacts are your host provider and cloudflare and not you directly, which was why they were served the legal notice.

- No, this is direct connection to Cloudflare for business offices and data centers, skipping all ISPs along the way. It's complimentary with VPN, not competitive. When I'm working at home, my laptop is VPN'd to my office network. Which /could/ now have direct Cloudflare access. ([astroburnham](https://twitter.com/AstroBurnham/status/1443239157489442827))
- No, of course, also if you use a VPN, but it will be great if they could work without any middleman, but there is no interest on promoting that. Only firefox and cloudflare did something about it with ESNI but now future looks grim. ([kabutor_](https://twitter.com/Kabutor_/status/1442773456530067456))
- Ah, I can't fault you for that. I'd say that tailscale could integrate Lynk in the future, but lynk isn't really meant to be a peer to peer network/VPN like tailscale is - it's supposed to be an application delivery controller that lets you control traffic to your backends ([confusedqubit](https://twitter.com/confusedqubit/status/1442200992506957834))

- (...) It's deprecated now, but there are still cookies Cloudflare injects in order to keep track of you.

- Chances are you're running a VPN or something else which flags your IP to the Cloudflare protecting the government website. Not a lot of people need access to citizen specific web pages on Iraqi domains, hence the locked down nature to protect the websites from attack ([iraqbasic](https://twitter.com/IraqBasic/status/1390294780391804929))
- Baghdad government servers are rickety, incapable of withstanding DDOS attack (when an attacker intentionally overloads a website with automated traffic). Ministries won't pay for protection from services like Cloudflare, so requiring a captcha for all traffic is their solution. ([dmbenes](https://twitter.com/DMBenes/status/1390259870683877378))

- Why does it no longer offer anonymity? Was it after changes were made before an update just before Operation Onymous, or the scripts that were running when set not to. If people log in with their details, their cover is blown. Most sites block Tor or give captchas. ([feelitworking](https://twitter.com/FeelitWorking/status/1388666066038046723))

- I think Cloudflare is great but its MITM approach is not very privacy-friendly, there are more privacy-friendly ways (for us) to provide security and reliability to our customers and users. We're probably a special case since we're very privacy-focused and a bit overzealous. ([ardewes](https://twitter.com/ardewes/status/1372149329092345858))
- I started using Cloudflare in 2015 because they offered free TLS certificates (back then a simple cert cost 100's of ‚Ç¨ per year), but obviated that need.

- This is totally irritating me, I cannot find a browser old/limited enough to get the captcha shown but new enough to connect at all (TLSv1.2) and render JS and the GUI CAPTCHA.

- Christ you‚Äôre thick.

([kyleolbert](https://twitter.com/KyleOlbert/status/1329642529646653441))

- It's extreme, but the threat vector isn't "MITM breaking TLS" - it's a misconfigured device that handles your TLS. For example, when Cloudflare or AWS ALB manage your certs, they can see everything unencrypted and in theory could leak data (like what happened to Cloudflare).

- The site is has gotten really slow all of the sudden in the last 10 minutes, even got a Cloudflare error at one point saying the site was unavailable. Just thought I'd let you know in case you're not aware. ([mfdwx](https://twitter.com/mfdwx/status/1306611375729446913))
- been getting this error for a while: The web server is not returning a connection. As a result, the web page is not displaying.

- And all I'm seeing at that link is a "Error 502 Bad Gateway" Cloudflare error page. Coincidence? I think not. ([bennycemoli](https://twitter.com/BennyCemoli/status/1305484079488475139))
- Is your service down? I was in a conference but I'm now getting a Cloudflare "Forbidden" error page. ([fanahova](https://twitter.com/FanaHOVA/status/1305922279356981250))
- Can I say can‚Äôt even given the chance to lock yourself out of accounts, because the cloudflare/google ‚Äúoh no you seem to be using tor‚Äù recursive captcha loop from hell will consume you. ([synackpse](https://twitter.com/synackpse/status/1305184010893701121))
- or use Cloudflare to protect your blog and add a captcha to the contact form ([justmeddling](https://twitter.com/justmeddling/status/1301504201026084865))
- Yes, that's work and I know, that's not hCaptcha's issue. But when I pass the captcha, returns me again and again to that. I think, that is and problem with IPs. ([snosratiershad](https://twitter.com/snosratiershad/status/1299392330139660289))
- Weird, I think it might be a cloudflare issue again, Twitch died for me and not long after I got error coded in Destiny. The game is just telling me the servers are down but everyone seems to be having different issues ([envyuwu](https://twitter.com/envyuwu/status/1305041990510415874))
- Starting to see an increased error rate for websites behind again. We'll keep an eye on the situation as it develops. ([hetrixtools](https://twitter.com/HetrixTools/status/1305039576117972992))
- did the site just stop loading images? I'm getting a cloudflare error when I try to load one ([rawmorella](https://twitter.com/rawmorella/status/1304940118462083078))
- But I still cannot access the page. Cloudflare says there is a error in the host. ([zx_role](https://twitter.com/Zx_role/status/1304897769153282049))

- I am having trouble using your site, the Gift Wizard, won't allow me to select a suburb, and clicking on any sections of the site gives me a Cloudflare 524 error site timed out. ([juddlehmkuhl](https://twitter.com/JuddLehmkuhl/status/1304327940327575552))
- Got through.. Submit payment.. Cloudflare Error. GG to me. I tried. ([jxstnaid](https://twitter.com/JxstNaid/status/1304164804303745027))
- Cloudflare pushing a captcha to users trying to login from the same IP they've had for 3 years. Unbranded friction. Wonder if Wave signed off on this. ([markriffey](https://twitter.com/MarkRiffey/status/1303022960526016513))
- Have an RSS feed for your site. Use Cloudflare? Configure it not to throw a captcha on those URLs. RSS readers read RSS not hCaptcha HTML pages! ([ekes](https://twitter.com/ekes/status/1301536008035594240))
- I have made posts on the CloudFlare community a long time ago, but can't login into CloudFlare now due to error 429 Too Many Requests cloudflare-lb ([partounian](https://twitter.com/partounian/status/1303789835648249856))

- yeah it's working now but i had a cloudflare error...weird :/c ([dantefucker](https://twitter.com/dantefucker/status/1303193147506393088))
- If you're getting a cloudflare error it's probably down for everyone or undergoing maintenance ([dobu_dobu](https://twitter.com/Dobu_Dobu/status/1303173705888038912))
- it looks like your servers are down again üòî. I got a couple of "error 500" on Trakt, with the Matrix background, and now it doesn't even do that, it's 524 on Cloudflare (host timeout). I hope you can find the issue. Thanks! ([ajperez81](https://twitter.com/ajperez81/status/1303067590999379968))
- Now we are experiencing that near 1-5% of all requests from cloudflare workers to gcloud services (storage, run, etc) responding with 525 error. Workaround is simple - retry fetch, now waiting for support to answer. ([icelabaratory](https://twitter.com/icelabaratory/status/1303043554651013121))

- Its not opening in Pakistan. Showing Error: This site can‚Äôt be reached i am not sure its banned by ISP's in Pakistan or by any Cloudflare services causing any issue, because cloudflare have issues from many days in Pakistan Region. ([azeeupdates](https://twitter.com/AzeeUpdates/status/1302315535103913984))
- Having weird issues with a site today. Started getting a Cloudflare error 1016 on LAN and on mobile data (not connected to network), but Gtmetrix, Pingdom and a TOR browser saw the site fine. Can't believe it would be a local cache issue since we saw an error on mobile as well. ([mattsingley](https://twitter.com/mattsingley/status/1301980453142892544))
- I tried that too, same results, still seeing error 1016 ([deluxetom](https://twitter.com/deluxetom/status/1301967551501488128))
- Not sure about Azure, but IIS log does contain this error. As said in the previous, the error was caused by Cloudflare sending an "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" in the proxied request. So the temporary solution is filter this header out until they fix at their side. ([seraphsx](https://twitter.com/Seraphsx/status/1301914513470640130))
- This issue is from Cloudflare, nothing to do with Azure. (Although the error is from Azure/IIS) ([seraphsx](https://twitter.com/Seraphsx/status/1301891943673274371))
- I have just installed elementor on a dedicated server - now says license could not be validated... yesterday i was seeing errors in their error messages - so my guess is that it's a poorly configured cloudflare setup ([jasonchargedm](https://twitter.com/jasonchargedm/status/1301573926326337538))
- Error 520 sez Cloudflare. Must be getting lots of hits. ([cajunfj40](https://twitter.com/cajunfj40/status/1301520269174083589))
- Also think of what can do with all the data they currently MITM. Add the DoH query data to it and they also know about websites you visit that they don't MITM. ([kingslyj](https://twitter.com/kingslyj/status/1301859976093155329))
- Come on sort it out. Same as yesterday, dead on 14:30 BST Cloudflare error pages for most of the afternoon. Not a huge amount of use. ([nvelopuk](https://twitter.com/NvelopUk/status/1301153417310674955))
- tls1.0 et 1.1 c'est pas ultra safe en m√™me temps, tl1.3 c'est pas top par contre mais bon c'est mieux que avoir un MITM via cloudflare ([ramleseam](https://twitter.com/RamleSeam/status/1300795041888243716))
- Then why do you use Cloudflare on your homepage and use it to MITM the login? Cloudflare does not abide by the DMCA. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1300557721536790530))
- The failing to save problem was the same as the Cloudflare problem I've been having (support ticket 915489, which I was told was escalated to the engineering team last week) but the Cloudflare CAPTCHA doesn't come up like it had and now I can't log in, which never happened before ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1301219981758267394))
- Yeah, its like the irony of using a "decentralized application" and receiving a Cloudflare error. Just wow. ([cryptocorral](https://twitter.com/CryptoCorral/status/1300666274951749632))
- including Cloudflare. Cloudflare‚Äôs systems routed around the problem, however, some Internet properties that use Cloudflare saw increased error rates during the impact period despite our mitigations. ([baselabubakr](https://twitter.com/baselAbubakr/status/1300377218707849216))
- 3 games had already concluded. All of us in india faced internal server error for about 2 minutes on chesscom including the players. If you go to cloudflare status site, you will see regiona affected due to this outrage. ([kunalkp87](https://twitter.com/kunalkp87/status/1300100199449206784))
- Ed, with all due respect.. 2nd round should have been played and then the appeal should have continued..today cloudflare also mentioned it was a global outage. A lot of us in India faced internal server error for about 2 minutes on chesscom.. ([kunalkp87](https://twitter.com/kunalkp87/status/1300084967255408640))
- It's a Lyric Round WiFi Thermostat. There's no reset wifi option in the app. I get unable to reach server error. I've had previous dm with my Mac address if you need it. Does the issue have to do with the cloudflare/centurylink outage? ([d3fung](https://twitter.com/d3fung/status/1300084527294033922))
- si tu fait un site sans faire nimporte quoi et le rendre lourdingue il tiens facilement dans 100-200Ko avec de la compression et sur un faible traffique √ßa tiens correctement donc pourquoi payer un VPS ou passer par le MITM cloudflare ([ramleseam](https://twitter.com/RamleSeam/status/1300011766471155712))
- FYI: Cloudflare is down and it‚Äôs supplying error messages to anyone registering with Indie Untangled Everywhere. üò´ Hopefully this will be resolved soon. ([indieuntangled](https://twitter.com/indieuntangled/status/1300080517661024257))

- New as of yesterday went to set it up on Roku, now I can't access that or Fire Sling app. Yesterday was fine. No anything for help. Cloudflare issues? No phone, site, help or access with without the error starting with Error 1016 Ray...or that 10-100 ([sailanation](https://twitter.com/SailaNation/status/1300063540674465798))
- August 30, 2020. I cannot sign in either on the website, trying to reach the signin page simply returns a Cloudflare error page, and the ROKU SlingTV app is not working either. I assume that's also a signin problem. Just thought you'd like to know. ([bennycemoli](https://twitter.com/BennyCemoli/status/1300060622558769153))
- When is the DNS error through CloudFlare going to be resolved. Can't login to SlingTV ([johnt757uv](https://twitter.com/johnt757uv/status/1300059932692283392))

- Yes, that's work and I know, that's not hCaptcha's issue. But when I pass the captcha, returns me again and again to that. I think, that is and problem with IPs. ([vharveyifa](https://twitter.com/VharveyiFa/status/1299392330139660289))
- how is it that I have to solve THREE captchas of and and again land on the captcha resolving page instead of getting the ORCID resolved? I cannot even access your main page. You should kick and out. ([rvb_siberia](https://twitter.com/rvb_siberia/status/1299174163698065418))
- Also using is nearly impossible with my suspicious Siberian IP address. I log in, clone or push a project - I solve a captcha. This breaks git command line tools, since about two weeks. How many hours per day am I supposed to solve ([rvb_siberia](https://twitter.com/rvb_siberia/status/1299171603432042496))
- Let's try. (some moments later...) Now I get a Failed Captcha (or something like that. The message is hidden behind Firefox URLs) ([robsonsobral](https://twitter.com/robsonsobral/status/1299130659919794177))
- Call for Pitches link in the tweet showed a cloudflare message. So I tried the site. Site denied access, even after checking captcha. Now I tried again and site shows Error 1020 Access Denied after captcha procedure ([jencysamuel](https://twitter.com/JencySamuel/status/1298132170133737472))
- Your site & mobile app are down due to a CloudFlare Error 1020 so visitors are all being blocked. Guess there will be no movies for us on this rainy day. ([fugitivealien](https://twitter.com/fugitivealien/status/1299760722730266625))

- I am currently unable to access your website over Tor due to an Error 1020 access denied error. Could you please reconsider your Cloudflare settings? Some of us like to browse the web without being spied on by our ISPs. ([happysmash27](https://twitter.com/happysmash27/status/1298149158990348288))
- Unable to login. Getting Error 1020 from CloudFlare. ([bluemint_io](https://twitter.com/bluemint_io/status/1297907064270774272))
- Thank you, but I do not think this is the problem I am encountering- I am seeing the Cloudflare CAPTCHA page in my screenshot above when I am already logged in- I write a post, try to save draft, but it redirects me to Cloudflare page instead of saving my draft, losing my work ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297941070156832768))
- What settings do I need to change? Nothing has changed on my side to prompt this, this happens across browsers, and I have checked my IP address as listed on the CAPTCHA page on Project Honeypot as suggested Cloudflare community support and my IP is not blacklisted ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297929659049533443))
- Cloudflare has declared war on PIA's VPN It's captcha's every where I turn. ([gshinhwa](https://twitter.com/gShinhwa/status/1297310733458341888))
- How come your PhishTank is now delivering an invasive Cloudflare CAPTCHA to my browser? Cloudflare treats some ISPs like garbage. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1296835586402275332))
- Unfortunately, is too lazy and/or incompetent to use a real CAPTCHA system. Instead, they take the lazy way out and use the worthless reCAPTCHA. ([nickhillebran](https://twitter.com/NickHillebran/status/1296607396878524416))
- Nope, I don't use proxies or vpn, everything worked as usual but since yesterday I'm not able to access anything and sites using cloudflare give me that error ([finchnoise](https://twitter.com/finchnoise/status/1297215159145041921))
- is the site still down or being crashed users again everytime i ry to access the site im being met with error code 1020 from cloudflare ([manaicgamein](https://twitter.com/Manaicgamein/status/1297065648175173632))
- Cloudflare is a centralized MITM-type service which does not only have privacy issues, but nature is also detrimental to a free & open internet. Therefor it doesn't fit Linux IMO. ([stp_kitt](https://twitter.com/STP_KITT/status/1293299843037892610))
- Well, that is nearly exactly what happened to me and why I began this crusade against the BS policies of Cloudflare and lack of stewardship. They did not help me at all. Dozens of rogue sites stayed online scamming consumers after multiple abuse reports. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1296281227687854084))
- Wouldn't be surprised if they gave you an exemption to having to fill out those CAPTCHA forms. This goes back way before Cloudflare even went public. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1297323884014981137))
- i can't even access that site it gives me a cloudflare error orz. there was actually an entire twitter post with a proper translation for yurushii's interview going around at one point, i'll see if i can find the actual thread again ([yowainee](https://twitter.com/yowainee/status/1297600254326513665))
- Very odd, sorry I can't be of more help - it must be an error on Cloudflare's side. ([snappyhost](https://twitter.com/SnappyHost/status/1297258101184364546))
- Yipe...getting Cloudflare error 1016 when attempting to access Hopin. ([ccritt93](https://twitter.com/CCritt93/status/1296808860481654785))
- FYI. Cloudflare is throwing an Error 1016, Origin DNS Error for your site. ([thevakman](https://twitter.com/TheVakman/status/1296769235298013185))
- I'm not sure what is going on but it seems like every site that i visit that uses your services keeps forcing a 'are you human' check.  That makes me close the tab and not even bother.  Is it a browser setting causing this ? or are all cloudflare this paranoid? ([csgeek](https://twitter.com/csgeek/status/1295141878942167040))
- I keep answering 's CAPTCHA and it just asks me all over again. This is a scam. Do let bully you into using the CAPTCHA tool. This is soooo frustrating. ([muni_encinitas](https://twitter.com/muni_encinitas/status/1294452859522576386))
- love the early days of cloudflare getting popular when random static content would be captcha-walled ([puffyvolvo](https://twitter.com/puffyvolvo/status/1293340470635114504))
- cloudflare really annoying lately with a lot of servers requesting captcha checks constantly ([jokalido](https://twitter.com/jokalido/status/1292976406532698114))

- When attempting to read messages from the API, I am receiving error code 1020? Google yields no results, outside of Cloudflare saying 1020 is Access Denied? ([thepackle](https://twitter.com/ThePackle/status/1293727554088710149))
- Bitdefender Central also does not work. It either shows a cloudflare error message or gets stuck and then returns you to the beginning of the login process AFTER you already logged in. I hope you guys did not get hacked. ([erjlem](https://twitter.com/erjlem/status/1293501465026334721))
- My Patreon page is being weird because it throws up this questionable looking cloudflare captcha every time I click on something. ([elle_astrid](https://twitter.com/elle_astrid/status/1295423965909807106))
- If Cloudflare truly believes in free speech, why am I blocked all of their corporate accounts? Why do they censor comments on their blog their critics? Why do they attempt to censor reviews on third party sites? Free speech when it serves them or is convenient. Anyway... ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1294431505268248576))
- This cloudflare captcha crap on Patreon when I‚Äôm posting an update is ticking me off. It says to prevent it make sure your computer is virus free. Mine is & it still gives me the captcha every time. I think it‚Äôs a ploy to DL a browser extension. ([karlkleese](https://twitter.com/KarlKleese/status/1294460722341191680))
- Great! Pls, get rid of cloudflare. Every hour captcha hell, no vpn or any proxy. ([aleonidovitch](https://twitter.com/ALeonidovitch/status/1294319107303768064))
- captchas makes it so I can't visit some sites now. Verify I am human but it doesn't refresh / forward to the site I'm visiting as expected. Manual refresh brings captcha again, often with none of what they are asking you to click on. Refresh on some sites work ([matrixglitch1](https://twitter.com/MatrixGlitch1/status/1290753303765286913))
- Question why do I always have to click umbrellas on cloudflare but Shopify hasn‚Äôt made captcha a standard in there api -- ? ([la3life](https://twitter.com/La3Life/status/1290264301458976770))

- Michelle as a woman why do you allow revenge porn sites on your network and call it free speech? As a mother, why do you allow child porn sites on your network? Why do you allow Matthew to strong arm you on Cloudflare policies? I can't believe you agree with them. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1289027752855842816))
- Starting to find edge services such as cloudflare to be super annoying! Every other website keeps asking me to do captcha.

- I've been wondering this myself. I've also considered that maybe these Cloudflare people, have taken away bitchute credentials in order to block them from public view. Maybe I should try to reach them on Tor Browser. ([AlarikOdinsson](https://twitter.com/AlarikOdinsson/status/1197684550446415872))
- Two months ago, I cancelled my Cloudflare account and told them to delete my data. Today, they've emailed me their new privacy policy because I'm still a customer!

- I love Tor, but too many sites are inaccessible when using it, thanks to CDNs imposing captchas on Tor connections, which don‚Äôt render properly because they all use Google stalkertech.

- If you‚Äôre in EU, the US can force Cloudflare to spy on you for them. At least your Dutch ISP only had to comply with warrants from a few countries.

- Did you know a foreign-owned cloud provider has access to online votes on their way to the digital ballot box? When electors in Canada‚Äôs Northwest Territories vote online, their ballots pass through Cloudflare servers and are briefly decrypted while in transit. ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543023636897792))
- As a protection against denial-of-service attacks you can pay cloud providers to act as a kind of friendly man-in-the-middle. But protection comes in exchange for a high degree of trust: they need access to application-layer data to do things like inject fingerprinting JavaScript ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543026853941248))
- That means they have privileged access to see and change your vote. The legitimacy of the election relies on the assumption they won‚Äôt.

- You mean you offload your problems onto legit customers using cloudflare to block every VPN you can find. Emailing isn't going to help, since I have no intention of surfing w/o one. So will start looking for a company that cares about customer security. ([CFSummers](https://twitter.com/CFSummers/status/1189941994170269696))

- If someone finds themselves wrongly blocked, they can't go to Cloudflare to complain because Cloudflare has blocked them from that site as well. So every day they sentence thousands of people to Internet purgatory because they got randomly handed an  IP address they blocked. ([random_interrup](https://twitter.com/random_interrup/status/1191798471914852352))
- Y'all need to dump Cloudflare. I'm blocked from your site without cause. ISPs randomly hand out IPs all day and I've inherited one they've blocked.

- Cloudflare acts as a MITM. In other words, the client connects via HTTPS to their servers, not to the actual website, and then they connect to the actual server.

- Ask why Cloudflare keeps on using Google‚Äôs reCAPTCHA when they can do their own.  ([rom](https://twitter.com/rom/status/1151423727629828096))
- Looks like a Cloudflare issue. This is why I don't trust Cloudflare. So many people use it, which puts them into a position of being a gateway to information. You have to go through them to get to your favorite site. The perfect climate for a marxist censorship takeover. ([Scarasyte](https://twitter.com/Scarasyte/status/1151604200754884609))

- You see, when the secure connection gets to Cloudflare, they do what is called SSL termination -- that means they end the secure connection so they can do a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. So any website you enter private information on, that uses Cloudflare, they get that info. ([cqwww](https://twitter.com/cqwww/status/1146117149297016832))

- Based on Cloudflare? A company that is US based and would allow intelligence agencies with nearly no effort to spy on all users at once? This is no enhancement. Just use a local recursive resolver like unbound if you don't like the blocking of your ISP. ([RealityAbsorber](https://twitter.com/RealityAbsorber/status/1147877776768294921))

- So recently Patreon moved behind Cloudflare. Now my patreon-feed library doesn't work because the setup Cloudflare has for Patreon requires CAPTCHA before it will let you through, and that fucks up with the feed. ([daemionfox](https://twitter.com/daemionfox/status/1149090123432255489))
