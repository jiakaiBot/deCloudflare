- was down a bit, anyone else has codepinIsDown Cloudflare error 502 Me:💻🥲 Everyone else: 😪🛌 DEVCommunity frontenddev uxdesign uidesign webdesigner webdev ([whimsyniche](https://twitter.com/whimsyniche/status/1446033557932105735))
- Oh fuck 😅 steps = exercism. I meant to say I follow his steps by doing exercism tasks. ([hexmint](https://twitter.com/hexmint/status/1447525243040399360))
- Cloudflare tried something similar, when Near passed away. They didn't respond, though; at all, so Netflix is fucking up already. ([icze4r](https://twitter.com/icze4r/status/1447741847137366021))
- Cloudflare are there any known issues with access to cloudflare reverseproxied websites from users in Russia? Seems to have started approximately 30 minutes ago and still there. ([rainbowderpyyay](https://twitter.com/RainbowDerpyYaY/status/1446154175528804358))
- Hey, so i have noticed when i use 1.1.1.1 on my phone, it is awesome for everything except Whatsapp. It makes my msgs take maybe 200-500ms slower than without it. It gives me the spin wheel then delivers. Is this expected behaviour or should this not be the case? ([justasking4know](https://twitter.com/justasking4know/status/1446131372276420612))
- We saw huge growth of the Outline VPN in Turkmenistan in 2020, but on January 31, 2021, we started losing our users. I wonder how that aligns with the aggressive blocking of clouds and hosting providers. ([vinifortuna](https://twitter.com/vinifortuna/status/1447648395900985348))
- Hi those requests can be safely ignored/blocked. No spec yet; it's a WIP feature. That said, I don't think you should even be getting these requests, let alone hammered with them. I'm sorry. I'll disable the fetches until we can fix the triggering logic. ([twifkak](https://twitter.com/twifkak/status/1446853287383212033))
- I am getting a cloudflare "access denied" error everytime I try to access your site. Is it because I am trying to access it from the US? ([theshanemason](https://twitter.com/theshanemason/status/1447642396070604804))
- Fixed the parsing logic, everything runs fine on localhost. But the Digital Ocean droplet gets a Cloudflare captcha now🤔 Thinking of ways to solve this... ([pie_tre](https://twitter.com/pie_tre/status/1447621413318299658))
- Cloudflare Don't you think that asking captcha after 1 single password failure is quite excessive? ([colevr](https://twitter.com/colevr/status/1447526744966184963))
- Realizing that Solanart's cloudflare protection is making my scraper solve a CAPTCHA -- will look into a permanent fix tomorrow. ([avinashj_](https://twitter.com/avinashj_/status/1447489543960027137))
- Yeah, still more accurate than Cloudflare's image selections according to objects captcha (currently in SkyscraperCity was hit by Cloudflare's attack every one day forever) ([firzafp](https://twitter.com/firzafp/status/1447363048243548162))
- Still getting the cloudflare error page on all three browsers. sorry- ([musciguy](https://twitter.com/musciguy/status/1447319594863980551))
- captcha from cloudflare make me lazy visit coingecko. 😭 ([snguyscrypto](https://twitter.com/SNGuysCrypto/status/1447268523361935360))
- Apperently they blocked VPNs Server (Including Cloudflare's WARP) so we can't have a full functioning Quota rather than "Education Centered" ([sen2402_](https://twitter.com/sen2402_/status/1447250025675821061))

- In response to censorship circumvention, Turkmenistan blocked all DoH servers, Cloudflare, AWS, Google Cloud and many other hosting providers. Most external services don't work. This a major and unique InternetShutDown, but no one is talking about it. /cc KeepitOn ([vinifortuna](https://twitter.com/vinifortuna/status/1446513149390241794))
- Found a flaw in Cloudflare design - login page errors out & to contact support you have to log in first. No way to communicate about login problems (not user/pw related). Page error: API Request Failed: POST /api/v4/login (403) ([sebastianmealer](https://twitter.com/sebastianmealer/status/1446896929955217408))
- Already did, hopes are up because I woke up to AWS Bill ([marxvolt](https://twitter.com/marxvolt/status/1446835423762960384))
- It rejects the form on the basis of the URL. Which as you can see uses your NS. And now I’ve notified you here as well. ([tomroyal](https://twitter.com/tomroyal/status/1446468075683975178))
- I can't, as your form won't accept the URL. ([tomroyal](https://twitter.com/tomroyal/status/1446431228857573380))
- Every time I clicked any link in my WP Admin Dashboard I got a Cloudflare error message that the site was offline and Try for Live again. Each time I clicked it WP Admin Dashboard was live. ([jamesbliss](https://twitter.com/JamesBliss/status/1446607903427895299))
- The cloudflare for polybucks still causes a 404 error on Mobile dapp browsers. I have to go to the main bsc buckswap first then go back to polybucks. Get it fixed! It is infuriating. ([rorowear](https://twitter.com/rorowear/status/1446463541217660932))

- Cloudflare trying to log into our dashboard and it's an endless login loop. Something broken? ([iamgerardthomas](https://twitter.com/iamgerardthomas/status/1446238119347437571))
- There's now a different error message about Cloudflare..? ([hobgoblintc_](https://twitter.com/hobgoblintc_/status/1446169819854876682))
- If you see an error, note that most errors mean the page falls back to normal search result behavior (as if no SXG were present). ([twifkak](https://twitter.com/twifkak/status/1446165333945950226))
- Fuck you I just wanted Lafayette and its sold out during to Cloudflare being a shit host of your line ([watervaporeon](https://twitter.com/watervaporeon/status/1446154071115636741))
- whoever uses Cloudflare and bans AS6939 just because people use HE for IPv6 are fucking idiots just my grouchy-ass opinion, of course NO I won't disable IPv6 for this or change ISPs to get IPv6 ([yakkoj](https://twitter.com/yakkoj/status/1446145963492585472))
- How can i get my PC unbaned, its now bin 2 weeks that i cannot accass any cloudflare protected site, not even the dashboard sometimes. Cookies cleard, browser reinstalled, new public IP. Other PCs of my home network work fine. ([bolverblitz](https://twitter.com/BolverBlitz/status/1446155990026629121))
- Cloudflare and other platforms do this as they check for spoofing (they match against known Google IPs for example) :-) You can see by using the Google mobile friendly test or URL Inspection they won't be blocking G/Bing tho. But for crawling, you'll need to use a different UA. ([screamingfrog](https://twitter.com/screamingfrog/status/1446075756258398215))
- Powerwashed my Chromebook this morning, but now will not login due to Cloudflare blocking. Maybe time to switch back to ? ([sean_bolton](https://twitter.com/sean_bolton/status/1446021850799169537))
- Will the website be fix? Cloudflare is blocking all of us. Get it fix! rollercoin ([stogie_era](https://twitter.com/Stogie_era/status/1445961955391557634))
- Fuck tech monopolies I can't get into nitropanel because cloudflare has too much traffic so my server is down ([hasrock36](https://twitter.com/hasrock36/status/1445849783491436548))
- Cloudflare, sometimes stop me from visiting a website even when it is available and never apologised for it. 😂 ([i_relish_code](https://twitter.com/i_relish_code/status/1445795825628553216))

- - Google captcha is your friend. - Check on Cloudflare if it comes from certain countries or IP and block it. - Ask for email validation. ([saasryan](https://twitter.com/SaasRyan/status/1445597535599353861))
- hi, I need some help please I Actived the cloudflare in my site wordpress and now is with 501 error ([botequin](https://twitter.com/botequin/status/1445505975838928901))
- I'm still salty about DoH. Fuck Mozilla, and fuck Cloudflare for pushing it. ([da_667](https://twitter.com/da_667/status/1445490562547609606))
- I wonder more about the cloud providers like AWS, azure, Cloudflare, etc. Take those out and a lot of the Internet would stop ([serraotweets](https://twitter.com/serraotweets/status/1445536490952429574))
- New routers + Pi 4-based pi-hole + Cloudflare DNS = faster, more stable internet access with network-wide ad blocking at home. ([jjtanner](https://twitter.com/jjtanner/status/1445533869403357193))
- This is 1.1.1.1's VNP icon . It usually appears when you turn on the VPN on your smartphone ([cuongn98](https://twitter.com/CuongN98/status/1445581414250864645))
- All of our IPs? I've never had any issues accessing Cloudflare websites, except maybe some extra CAPTCHAs here and there, and I'm always connected to the VPN. ([cryptostorm_is](https://twitter.com/cryptostorm_is/status/1445543157588893710))
- except...hungerrush is down too. error and then cloudflare 502 every time i try to place an order ([big_top_energy](https://twitter.com/big_top_energy/status/1445462425893945350))
- so i had to fix the cloudflare gateway cert to then be able to see the blocked message ([iphigenie](https://twitter.com/iphigenie/status/1445451821523234819))
- Hey Cloudflare super bot fight mode is awesome, but you gotta give us the ability to bypass it. I find myself turning it off frequently b/c our automated tasks are getting blocked. ([spdean](https://twitter.com/spdean/status/1445451802619494413))
- I'm locked out of my account by cloudflare and have been for over a day now. This seems like an outage that is only affecting some users. Can you comment on this error 1020 issue? ([tmlutas](https://twitter.com/TMLutas/status/1445449130369716224))
- No, I try to point out the problem. Maybe they solve it creative something like race queue. I don't have time for other jobs, but I can make some advice. (And yes I use product portal for that, but they just use old Cloudflare captcha.) ([zedrunbotspec](https://twitter.com/ZedRunBotSpec/status/1445444727151620098))
- They become the victim instead of the perpetrator. It's is fascinating hypothesis but the cause was so epically lame at the same time, it seems hard to believe it was deliberate. ([askwpgirl](https://twitter.com/askwpgirl/status/1445432029001048066))
- If you use undetectedchromedriver, selenium and proxy for solving cloudflare captcha you have some bot. Like was in my channel description. ([zedrunbotspec](https://twitter.com/ZedRunBotSpec/status/1445419594479554574))
- The only way to be "so certain, so fast" that "there was no malicious activity behind this outage" is if no human was involved anywhere. Also, Cloudflare offered to bail FB out and get them quickly back online to stop the $13 million / hour hemorrhage. Why refuse CF's offer? ([svpndotcom](https://twitter.com/svpndotcom/status/1445417224131469314))
- Error humano al dejar de anunciar vía eBGP, paso al edge BGP y todo internet (routers) convergen por ese cambio. No creo que solo fué la 1.1.1.1, sino toda una clase o gran parte de la misma. El edge BGP tiene todas las rutas de internet sumarizadas, incluida las de facebook ([jfmirror](https://twitter.com/jfmirror/status/1445400382528802819))
- Yeah, I forgot "human error" and "glitch in the Matrix". Oh, and of course "Morten fell over a cable." 😅 ([rschu](https://twitter.com/rschu/status/1445397373627379729))
- The web didn't break Google just did a rookie mistake and forgot to renew some certs. However,cloudflare or Google going down would break the internet.Cloudflare gone down before and that lead to a fuck ton of the internet being inaccessible bc every1 relies on ddos protection ([sambagams](https://twitter.com/SamBaGaMs/status/1445396959020339205))
- Oh, you’re not taking about my “stop gouging on a couple of billing dimensions” style of consulting. The only future I try to predict is the cloud bill. ([quinnypig](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1445403636901814294))
- Well explained still wonder what happened in their network that caused to stop advertising their route to public DNS. ([ankit_enrique](https://twitter.com/ankit_enrique/status/1445390598689722376))
- Gracias por compartir Amigo Cloud, el incidente bien explicado por CloudFlare. Queda pendiente la Causa Raíz (error interno) que Facebook, nunca explicará. ([aaronbm2021](https://twitter.com/aaronbm2021/status/1445377287206187016))
- 🌍⚡ "Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht notes that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — BGP helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.”" well that's fucking awesome ([luisffierro](https://twitter.com/luisffierro/status/1445378531043815424))
- when will the website be working again? Cloudflare is blocking us all. rollercoin ([stogie_era](https://twitter.com/Stogie_era/status/1445373769363623939))
- Experimented with Cloudflare CDN the other day. It definitely slowed down my sites when accessed from the same region as my servers. Also, something about them playing the MiTM made me uncomfortable. ([saurabhg](https://twitter.com/saurabhg/status/1312527539449937923))
- Yeah, and even that can be ymmv I'm in education, and we have some low income families who access our services over TLS 1.0/1.1 for various reasons. We're not a target for mitm, I'm not worried serving static content. Also fronting with Cloudflare which adds other capabilities. ([nathanmcnulty](https://twitter.com/NathanMcNulty/status/1294761722398425088))
- Alternativ 1.1.1.1 und 1.0.0.1 sind die von Cloudflare. Angeblich der Schnellste, und anonymste. Wobei das evtl Augenwischerei ist. Habe momentan Twitter Probleme mitm Pixel im WLAN. Bilder laden teilweise nicht, Videos dann wiederum schon. Ganz kurios. ([bibloki](https://twitter.com/bibloki/status/1239330948229062664))
- I think it’s mostly due to TLS 1.0 and 1.1 using weaker encryption algorithms, easier for man in the middle attacks and stuff, the server itself isn’t put at risk as much as the end user is but attackers could still do wild stuff if they find a way to spoof as a privileged user ([rgriesemer3](https://twitter.com/rgriesemer3/status/1223651306516205575))
- Finde aber keine Info, ob Cloudflare das überhaupt anbietet. Der Standard-Service ist definitiv ein von der Original-Seite zugelassener MitM. ([heptasean](https://twitter.com/HeptaSean/status/1215542180774850560))
- È molto diverso conoscere che siti hai visitato, rispetto a sapere che siti hai visitato E ANCHE che contenuti specifici hai visto: Cloudflare non è solo DoH, ma anche un MitM legalizzato (aka una CDN). E la mia non è un ipotesi. ([giacomotesio](https://twitter.com/giacomotesio/status/1192829956964995072))
- The issue probably stemmed from a misconfiguration of Facebook's servers, which didn't let users connect to its sites. The problem was compounded when apps (and users) got error messages and kept trying to reconnect, sparking a "tsunami" of traffic, according to Cloudflare… ([telebusiness](https://twitter.com/telebusiness/status/1445322175083388936))
- Yes, very helpful. Look forward to learning what happened within FB. Odds are human error rather than human malice. But either way the outage should put policy makers on notice that “going digital” is by no means a risk-free option. ([zcobb](https://twitter.com/zcobb/status/1445321991142232067))
- Glad I saw this summary from Cloudflare about last night's facebookdown so I can stop doing my own. It has better pictures too. fragileworld facebookoutage ([peterahayes_pah](https://twitter.com/PeterAHayes_pah/status/1445293625236152325))

- „… end-users also won't take an error for an answer and start reloading the pages, or killing and relaunching their apps, sometimes also aggressively.“ 😉 Good one! ([ceetter](https://twitter.com/Ceetter/status/1445276948301815809))
- "end-users also won't take an error for an answer and start reloading the pages, or killing and relaunching their apps, sometimes also aggressively." Cloudflare on the Facebook outage ([lexplt](https://twitter.com/lexplt/status/1445274996625055755))
- Sure thing, an error caused us to push some settings to Cloudflare (a cloud provider we use) which resulted in the short outage. The error has been identified and we're taking multiple steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. ([sharesiesnz](https://twitter.com/SharesiesNZ/status/1445237590311981057))
- Not always though. There are definite DoS attacks against BGP out there which I would be sorely disappointed if fb feel victim to. ([kcjefff](https://twitter.com/kcjefff/status/1445226428329598976))
- As the Trump's election gets closer and closer, The New York Times / Washington Post will probably become extremely anxious, and put pressure on ISPs like Comcast / Verizon, or Cloudflare, to censor alternative platforms like Parler. ([gosoraproject](https://twitter.com/GosoraProject/status/1445209559400812551))
- Before looking out for Facebook try looking out for the ordinary American online shopper and stop doing business with Chinese Scam Artists... ([tom_strapp](https://twitter.com/tom_strapp/status/1445206430731186176))
- CloudFlare has a great explanation which is basically, "someone deleted the BGP record for DNS." Can't imagine how that could happen without some "help" from the inside. Wonder who didn't show up for work today at FB? ([steamrob42](https://twitter.com/steamrob42/status/1445188363057836038))
- fucking roskomnadzor and cloudflare! why the fuck should I come from the Netherlands to grab an album of my favorite music? fuck off your authorities! 🏴‍☠️ isengard blackmetal høstmørke ([cybertechno88](https://twitter.com/cybertechno88/status/1445180370249568260))
- Seems like a significant blast radius of DNS server advertisements we're in same prefix. Otherwise we are looking at larger error. ([cryptozugzwang](https://twitter.com/CryptoZugzwang/status/1445192854633078787))
- no it was a misconfiguration error plain and simple CloudFlare said it was, just very coincidental when it happened. if you understand how an intranet works, by the same error they couldnt resolve the internal network as well. could have scrubbed the database live. Lost billions ([forrestbmac](https://twitter.com/forrestbmac/status/1445180347868753926))
- I'm guessing they went to the other platform I deleted long ago, Nextdoor 😸 ([boba_tea_catan](https://twitter.com/Boba_Tea_Catan/status/1445164387874918403))
- Gordis deja de consumir la primera estupidez que miras Internet, cloudflare ya informo que sus tablas BGP fueron borradas y fue un error interno pues no se detecta ataques. ([restrep_1](https://twitter.com/Restrep_1/status/1445169760048660484))
- Yea, in addition many apps don't implement a Backoff policy to handle retries, so your server becomes flooded with millions of requests from the same client that always gets the same error in response... it's going to be a tough day for the network stabilize all services again ([arielgmachado](https://twitter.com/ArielGMachado/status/1445166524768083968))
- JohnCumming Cloudflare: issues appear to be stemming from a configuration error that saw “a large number of changes” take place to Facebook’s border gateway protocol BGP the underlying protocol which determines how traffic is physically routed and peered across the internet. ([ilatif](https://twitter.com/ilatif/status/1445135681467072513))
- Cloudflare, tweeted FB issues appear to be stemming from a configuration error which saw “a large number of changes” take place to Facebook’s border gateway protocol (BGP) – the underlying protocol which determines how traffic is physically routed and peered across the internet ([marcjohanssen](https://twitter.com/MarcJohanssen/status/1445109932584538119))
- I dare them to try to fuck with Cloudflare. I bet $100 to everyone on Twitter that nobody can touch that company. ([lightninglegend](https://twitter.com/LightningLegend/status/1445165687022833667))
- So, someone deleted large sections of the routing. That doesn't mean Facebook is just down, from the looks of it. That means Facebook is gone. is crazy mind blowing 🤯 ([alsa_eth](https://twitter.com/alsa_eth/status/1445150358414794757))

- Good article. Even for an IT idiot as myself, I can gather at least the breadth of this. FB is back now, but not fully functional. Clicking on my notifications brings up an error message. ([cking613](https://twitter.com/Cking613/status/1445157400588206083))

FBwillbebacksoon ([ilatif](https://twitter.com/ilatif/status/1445138301258719236))
- This happened in part because apps won't accept an error for an answer and start retrying, sometimes aggressively, and in part because end-users also won't take an error for an answer and start reloading the pages, or killing and relaunching their apps, sometimes also aggressive ([marcozelf](https://twitter.com/marcozelf/status/1445137923217711119))

- The exact cause of the outage has not been confirmed by Facebook, but one expert said the problem may have been caused by an internal error. web security firm CloudFlare said Facebook made a series of updates to its border gateway protocol (BGP) which caused it to 'disappear' ([computer495](https://twitter.com/Computer495/status/1445127512330326020))
- Probablemente la culpa sea de tu operador (ISP) y no de Wikipedia. He escuchado reportes de operadores qué sus DNS dan error. Así qué toca cambiarlos (y no uses el 1.1.1.1 de Cloudflare, está colapsado por demanda). ([phenobarbital](https://twitter.com/phenobarbital/status/1445116497311973380))
- Cloudflare, tweeted FB issues appear to be stemming from a configuration error which saw “a large number of changes” take place to Facebook’s border gateway protocol (BGP) – the underlying protocol which determines how traffic is physically routed and peered across the internet..

- Facebook could still have pulled the BGP configs, albeit unlikely, and it would look the same to CloudFlare. Just seems more suspicious since it's the day after the 60 Minutes interview, but most likely just an internal error during an update.

- Most likely a tech was trying to "fix an error" but caused a catastrophic failure that they have been rebuilding. Kinda like what cloudflare did when they killed the internet. ([amatthiesen98](https://twitter.com/amatthiesen98/status/1445105742353108993))
- It is believed that the outage is due to a domain name system (DNS) error. According to hosting service Cloudflare's chief technology officer a large number of border gateway protocol (BGP) withdrawals were noted approximately five minutes before the outage began. ([thevibesnews](https://twitter.com/thevibesnews/status/1445104652949733391))
- So... auction sites across the country have had "Cloudflare Error 1016" since Sept 30. Some of those auction sites have reported they had a ransomware attack. Now Facebookdown and Instagramdown? And they also use Cloudflare? Hmmm... TwitterMakingAComeback ([candipride](https://twitter.com/candipride/status/1445103338123628546))

- But it doesn't stop there. How many sites out there depend on cloudflare? AWS? DigitalOcean? If you wanna make sure-sure you can host your own server at home, but who does that? (hint: I don't). A "solution" to that would be to use providers that have a lower market share. ([thepaddev](https://twitter.com/ThePadDev/status/1445098468129837066))

- What? BGP routes for facebook being deleted has nothing to do with you being offline (or any AI censoring people). It's basically the protocol telling DNS providers (and thus you) where you can find the server for domain xy. (e.g. facebook) ([einwildespanda](https://twitter.com/EinWildesPanda/status/1445145941347119113))
- that a good techincal solution... But we still love 1.1.1.1 because we're still online 🧐😂 and that's work 😁who cares about an AI that censor people dividing them from what they really think 👍 Leaving an AI the importance of judging?

- Putting aside the swamping, could a 3rd party help them here? Eg Cloudflare advertise the routes FB deleted. Or would the FB networks just not accept the traffic now? ([bernieklein](https://twitter.com/bernieklein/status/1445132205576146950))
- I've read from Cloudflare that they have effectively deleted themselves off the Internet by removing all BGP peering and/or routes. Self-hosted DNS with no way to reach it will cause that. ([stoobert](https://twitter.com/Stoobert/status/1445129392674549766))
- RPKI wouldn't help. The authoritative owner was the one that poisoned the routes. This wasn't a Verizon killing Cloudflare situation. They deleted their own routes. RPKI must have okayed it. ([sandeepssrin](https://twitter.com/sandeepssrin/status/1445128751990272017))
- Dane, forgive my likely erroneous over-simplication but does this mean that someone or something could have simply deleted the A and AAA records for (probably many) Facebook domain names, and restoring service = replacing the lost DNS records? ([johnguilfoil](https://twitter.com/johnguilfoil/status/1445126522742972419))
- Somebody deleted Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram from the index, so the Internet does not know where to send them. ([_stevenwebb](https://twitter.com/_StevenWebb/status/1445115954258665481))

- And the world is a better place already. Dane Knecht, Senior VP of web security firm Cloudflare, says the FB Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes, used by networks to deliver internet traffic, have been 'withdrawn from the internet.' May have been stolen/deleted = epic hacking. ([lile_sosanna](https://twitter.com/Lile_sosanna/status/1445089051221143561))
- The fact they just deleted all the posts tells you what you need to know. ([flangey](https://twitter.com/flangey/status/1445084366636560384))

But then, you also need to be VPN'ing all your traffic, and trusting said VPN provider (I have to find one that is trustworthy), or all your efforts are ultimately pointless.

- I dearly LOVE Cloudflare services & price points. Might I ask that you look again at Super Bot Fight Mode? Awesome concept but it blocks cron jobs, scans, & from sending via SES, which makes it unusable for us. 😰😭 ([tompearson](https://twitter.com/tompearson/status/1444749811727671299))

- Wow, seven years ago. Maybe it's time to deprecate Flexible and Full SSL so HTTPS via Cloudflare is fully secured and not susceptible to MITM on the path to the origin. ([r1ch_tl](https://twitter.com/R1CH_TL/status/1389707459938357250))
- Before this, you'd have to send middle boxes, firewalls, VPN gear, MPLS connectivity, the whole kitchen sink to the new location.

- Cloudflare security blocks arbitrarily. I suspect a broad brush approach of ASN or large IP ranges painted as malicious. Their response?

- Don't play the victim card here because anyone with an IQ of a rock saw this coming from a mile away. Also, if you look up your own domain, the two points of contacts are your host provider and cloudflare and not you directly, which was why they were served the legal notice. ([studiokay](https://twitter.com/StudioKay/status/1436472478566477825))
- I deleted it, in case someone reads that far then stops. At some point Cloudflare should figure out being mercenaries for toxic groups is a bad look -- especially if they want a wider product portfolio than "we secure hate speech" ([trumpery45](https://twitter.com/Trumpery45/status/1414729546805366784))
- No, this is direct connection to Cloudflare for business offices and data centers, skipping all ISPs along the way. It's complimentary with VPN, not competitive. When I'm working at home, my laptop is VPN'd to my office network. Which /could/ now have direct Cloudflare access. ([astroburnham](https://twitter.com/AstroBurnham/status/1443239157489442827))
- No, of course, also if you use a VPN, but it will be great if they could work without any middleman, but there is no interest on promoting that. Only firefox and cloudflare did something about it with ESNI but now future looks grim. ([kabutor_](https://twitter.com/Kabutor_/status/1442773456530067456))
- Ah, I can't fault you for that. I'd say that tailscale could integrate Lynk in the future, but lynk isn't really meant to be a peer to peer network/VPN like tailscale is - it's supposed to be an application delivery controller that lets you control traffic to your backends ([confusedqubit](https://twitter.com/confusedqubit/status/1442200992506957834))

- It is not "another", just the same nonstop dDoS attack. When you add capacity to your systems, volume of bad traffic will adjust automatically to the new level. CloudFlare could stop it.

- They are adding Cloudflare. That protection adds blocking access to certain criteria (such as countries, blocks of IP addresses and so on). It takes a bit of tweaking once installed to ensure proper people can get in. You block everyone and then start opening up. Give them time.

- I'd start at Paypal - let's see how Marty does when he loses his payment processor. From there Soundcloud. After that, Cloudflare. At that point, if slamwrestling doesn't take a shit on his head, their host will be my next stop. ([hluska](https://twitter.com/Hluska/status/1433571179097309190))
- It was the tool used to benchmark during this months. In Portugal (ISP: NOS) Quad9 is faster. and with a bonus of being also more secure - even when used the Cloudflare DNS w/malware blocking, Quad9 gets more blocks in known phishing/malware pages. Of course, this can vary :) ([dj_prmf](https://twitter.com/DJ_PRMF/status/1432795407852220418))
- (Small caveat: If you’re using Cloudflare or a similar service, they can do this for you with regular rewrite patterns. Since that initial request is unencrypted they essentially do a MITM attack…for good!) ([noahsbwilliams](https://twitter.com/noahsbwilliams/status/1431855180245389314))
- If you are using Cloudflare WARP, please don't update on the lasted build ❌ It has a serious bug that causes all MITM proxy apps won't work unless WARP is ON.

- Cloudflare is irritating me now 🙁 At first, I used their DNS service to reduce the impact of DDOS service, it did that well.

- Almost certainly most of the responses had status code of 403 instead of 5xx, as cloudflare kicked in and blocked you from making requests, as you made too many of them in short time span.

- What is the purpose of IPFS frontend, if the API is behind cloudflare? Any time a Tor user calls your API, he may be presented with captcha. This effectively bans Tor users. If you ban Tor users and use offchain servers, you can track or be forced to track everyone. No privacy. ([paulmillr](https://twitter.com/paulmillr/status/1430585457029517316))

- An SSL Handshake Failure or Error 525 means that the server and browser were unable to establish a secure connection. This can happen for a variety of reasons.

And when I try to reset password, it just doesn't email me ([user9684](https://twitter.com/User9684/status/1428731464670142473))
- CloudflareHelp I have a DNS problem but this account does not seem to be active anymore. If it is then notify me. ([biffkins](https://twitter.com/Biffkins/status/1425516151946170373))
- And why is Cloudflare blocking countries?! ([jshpigler](https://twitter.com/JShpigler/status/1428284867184406529))
- I keep thinking that CloudFlare is some kind of a weird human subject experiment on Tor users, like how many can be tricked into enabling JS. ([hackerb0t](https://twitter.com/hackerb0t/status/1428499699431051267))
- OK, this is getting silly now. Checked with Firefox. That Cloudflare Captcha you have installed that's popping up for me all over the web is causing an unresolvable loop! ([ponder65](https://twitter.com/Ponder65/status/1428782955401551877))
- You don't need headless browsers to avoid Cloudflare's captchas. Here's how: - Open the page in the browser, solve the captcha if needed - Open Dev Tools, grab all request headers from the Network Tab - When scraping, send the headers in the same order ... 👇 ([robertbalazsi](https://twitter.com/robertbalazsi/status/1428648052911443971))
- I cannot even reach the site. Seems to be blocked on DNS Level for me. Using the Cloudflare "Malware Blocking" DNS. ([tanukibtc](https://twitter.com/TanukiBTC/status/1428574244762439682))
- Oh, truly, I am sure amazon is trembling in its boots over the impending Gab marketplace... ...that will doubtless be hosted on cloudflare, because fuck everything, right? ([spiraldee](https://twitter.com/SpiralDee/status/1428364055928991744))
- I think it was CloudFlare in my region because another site other than medium resulted in that error briefly. ([andrewbrown](https://twitter.com/andrewbrown/status/1428425440054714372))
- Their profile page is giving that error from time to time, was seeing a Cloudflare DDOS screen a few minutes ago too. ([0xtycoon](https://twitter.com/0xTycoon/status/1428408253679955973))
- Has anyone had any issues getting blocked from websites by CloudFlare, anything I google about how to get around this crap is useless. ([maineman1979](https://twitter.com/MaineMan1979/status/1428438779304497154))
- Hey guys, right now a lot of users are getting a “Cloudflare error” when trying to log in on pc, how do we fix this? ([alphacyclonev2](https://twitter.com/AlphaCycloneV2/status/1428426167632240643))

- CloudflareHelp Hey, I keep getting "The content length is too large. (Code: 81041)" when trying to make an SMIMEA record. I can't make it shorter, as far as I am aware it needs to feature the full certificate, certificate hash isn't enough. How do I make the record? ([datjocab](https://twitter.com/DatJocab/status/1428312896107388935))
- hehehe its ok - its not u - i for some reason decided diagnostic logging on NSG would be great idea for a box that i ask people to fuck with LOL - i do normally put cloudflare on boxes to stop people busting the fek out of things as well ;) ([uk_daniel_card](https://twitter.com/UK_Daniel_Card/status/1428262528346468357))
- Cloudflare CloudflareHelp According to our own tests, it is certain that Cloudflare does not forward me when accessing websites. I only get a 503 error, but I don't have these problems with another device. Looks like intent and censorship. And websites are available and not 503 ([mari_ehansen](https://twitter.com/mari_ehansen/status/1428186484885139459))
- Probably just cloudflare or whatever other provider fucking up again ([dogeconomy](https://twitter.com/Dogeconomy/status/1418255834153463808))
- Is this why I suddenly have to keep clicking Captcha pics, here in Brazil? Why does it think I'm a bot? I hold $NET ([misterstringy](https://twitter.com/MisterStringy/status/1428042020430520320))
- Also doing IP based identity in the wider world.. Think of site backed by Cloudflare - it gets Cloudflare IP. Attacker could also use a Cloudflare IP so now that victim and attacker resolve to same IP, trying to tie identity to the IP sounds really dangerous. ([joonas_fi](https://twitter.com/joonas_fi/status/1428052236974841858))
- Stop using cloudflare. When you get dodos’d simply buy more server capacity like a real man ([fillialxbt](https://twitter.com/FillialXBT/status/1428049770975830018))
- Hi : are Shopify services effected? We are getting a 502 gateway error (cloudflare). It restored for a short while and is down again. ([zarlashtfaisal](https://twitter.com/ZarlashtFaisal/status/1427991254940504067))
- Once again Cloudflare being a growing abscess of the internet. I literally had to click on "the trucks" and "the airplanes" 20 times before they believed I'm human. Arseholes, stop fucking up the internet. ([martijnsaly](https://twitter.com/MartijnSaly/status/1427677618711760898))
- I really wish Cloudflare would stop whining about my super vanilla Ubuntu / Firefox Strict Mode / Mullvad VPN setup ([activefog](https://twitter.com/activefog/status/1427663562038784003))
- bruh now cloudflare and DNS is going to shit. What in the fuck even is this shitstorm of a week man. ([ceraphkeilah](https://twitter.com/CeraphKeilah/status/1418247186786263041))
- Ah fuck, Cloudflare fucked the cache for the website so the new update wasn't pushed to the bot. I added a fancy 0 balance indicator. ([yiaytoken](https://twitter.com/yiaytoken/status/1417608874593558532))
- (...) It's deprecated now, but there are still cookies Cloudflare injects in order to keep track of you. For example, when you're presented with the 'One more step' screen and pass the Captcha, you're given like 3. It's certainly an effective way of blocking "bad" traffic. (...) ([tomas_hozman](https://twitter.com/tomas_hozman/status/1427669475759955970))
- Cheerio is an HTML parser library that follows the convenient jQuery syntax to extract elements. I use it for one of the retailers (the other one needs Puppeteer because of CloudFlare blocking me). ([robertbalazsi](https://twitter.com/robertbalazsi/status/1427576655489425436))
- Why do I need to allow javascript from cloudflare to click a fucking button? ([schrotthaufen](https://twitter.com/schrotthaufen/status/1426287527103717377))
- I don't know who the fuck you are, Cloudflare, but anytime your name comes up, it's never good. Whatever it is you do, you certainly do a pretty damn shitty job of it! ([jonnygators](https://twitter.com/JonnyGators/status/1425159213958025222))
- So, wrapping up: Devs definitely bulk computed certain things The game uses a palette swap, one for each pokemon Color in consoles is weird Fuck CloudFlare ([indrora](https://twitter.com/indrora/status/1423420992978710529))
- KF in particular has hit a point where they had to start their own ISP (which is blocked from federating with multiple prominent internet nodes) and has been told by every provider besides CloudFlare to fuck off. ([invisibleup](https://twitter.com/InvisibleUp/status/1419022187831300096))
- No, Cloudflare is just a DNS. I don't use them, I use NextDNS, but for the same reason most people use Cloudflare: My privacy is my right and google etc can fuck off. ([beardedgeek72](https://twitter.com/BeardedGeek72/status/1418886145983795213))
- Much as I enjoy watching corporate proxy wars, Cloudflare can still absolutely go fuck themselves. I genuinely hope prison time is in the future of their executives for the things they've done to the internet. ([dave_universetf](https://twitter.com/dave_universetf/status/1418731042941267968))
- For this I used cloudflare's DNS rules to catch all the subdomains that were vulnerable. However, in hindsight, I should have used DNSMadeEasy or something so I didn't have to fuck with the SSL certs so much 🤣 ([mcoetus](https://twitter.com/MCoetus/status/1417604964759789571))
- Hey you, why you temp banned my cloudflare id ? Stinky ([iang67174822](https://twitter.com/IanG67174822/status/1426991928244064261))
- Pretty sure they straight-up banned GitHub or Cloudflare traffic or something - this is a page on GitHub pages behind cf ([princess_ravy](https://twitter.com/princess_ravy/status/1426209795107852289))
- So when Firefox started using Cloudflare DoH by default, without informing or asking users, I couldn't help but be suspicious. Imagine if they used their https web endpoints for DoH, too. There'd be no effective way to block DoH without blocking half the Internet. ([anachronistjohn](https://twitter.com/AnachronistJohn/status/1427031843702906880))
- is your api down? cant reach it, getting a cloudflare error only on EU routing, can access it with US routing, helpings pls ty ([alexvcsgo](https://twitter.com/alexvcsgo/status/1426878579296591877))
- Stopping Cloudflare would stop a large number of them. Cloudflare has a physical presence in Manchester, UK, and if the site in question has been accessed then content illegal in the UK is on their servers. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1426674068053442563))
- i think quad9 was a good provider, but since they got sued and now need to censor domains here in germany, i have to use other dns services for now. i don't know what cloudflare has done, but since cloudflare is based in america, its the better solution for germans like me. ([mrx1983](https://twitter.com/mrx1983/status/1411050383393361924))
- I do agree that hiding replies is weird and does implicate them. What I am saying is that prior to recent events, they could not have known. As soon as they are trying to censor things about it, than that is when they know. ([xeonthexeonian](https://twitter.com/XeonTheXeonian/status/1410450433529630720))
- Huh, weird that we say, "this is a morally culpable thing for people to do" and you to screech and cry "wah wah wah you're trying to CENSOR ME!!!!!" Nah, you can say what you want. You're just a bad person for it, is all. ([pullingaclaudia](https://twitter.com/Pullingaclaudia/status/1409658129969602560))
- the reason you said you liked this policy was that it meant a social dominant majority can't censor things at will. it can. it can seize a nation and censor, or have financial power and get stuff censored. there is no dominant majority currently unable to compel Cloudflare. ([sigmaveee](https://twitter.com/sigmaveee/status/1409536983924416515))
- In other words “I don’t like what these people have to say so im going to censor them” ([treetreetree799](https://twitter.com/TreeTreeTree799/status/1409516331075051527))
- Cloudflare This is your fault. You are the ones responsible for keeping Kiwi Farms alive and protected. They have claimed another victim, as if it's a game. This cannot go on. ([sterophonick](https://twitter.com/sterophonick/status/1409182264538324994))
- После массового перехода на CDN понятие MitM утратило актуальность. Напомни, какая доля мирового HTTPS трафика терминируется и расшифровывается Cloudflare, Amazon и Google? Так что hsts,caa,ds даже обходить не надо, расшифрованный трафик добровольно отдается в Cloudflare и т.д. ([phprus](https://twitter.com/phprus/status/1391039425027747849))
- Deet's. We don't question Australian internet infrastructure :) In all seriousness tho, CGNAT is dumb. The amount of times I've had to call for a new IP because I end up being blocked by Cloudflare or Google for whatever reason is beyond me. ([shaquilleray](https://twitter.com/ShaquilleRay/status/1426575057652879365))
- I can't login to the site from any browser, vpn on or off. No matter what, the Cloudflare page reloads and reloads. I can't even submit a ticket b/c no way to log in. I'm kind of lost on how to proceed. ([erileff](https://twitter.com/erileff/status/1426345087177461762))
- Why is it Cloudflare's job to censor the Internet? Do you really want them to do it? Should Comcast also censor the Internet? ([sambowne](https://twitter.com/sambowne/status/1418803014119280640))
- If CloudFlare becomes necessary to survive online, then CloudFlare gains the ability to censor the Internet. ([lukedashjr](https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1416491331631865858))
- As a victim of child pornography on a site that was protected by Cloudflare, I’d like to speak to you Matthew personally. I would like to further understand your morals & maybe you could understand mine. At this point talking is the only way to see another perspective . ([silenttruthhere](https://twitter.com/silenttruthhere/status/1413901604672188419))
- Is libertarianism and non involvement just code for ignoring basic human rights and letting people suffer? I know you don’t like to censor people but what if it was your family who were the victims of one of the dangerous and horrible sites Cloudflare provide security for? ([silenttruthhere](https://twitter.com/silenttruthhere/status/1413337319415889922))
- Bullshit. Turned off popup & ad blockers, tried 3 browsers, deleted history, cache & cookies, tried 'Accessibility cookie' option. It keeps returning to Verify page. I cannot login to Ebay at all now. This keeps happening & I see many others complaining online. I HATE hCaptcha. ([rwleslie2](https://twitter.com/rwleslie2/status/1412481361043243013))
- Sorry to seem a bit faux or strange, I just felt like the only way to get the petition out was to keep on sharing. I don’t speak much as I too was a victim of these sites. Doing this for the people, Near and to see Cloudflare burn. ([silenttruthhere](https://twitter.com/silenttruthhere/status/1411306662762270721))
- It's hard enough to get law enforcement et al. to "care" about, say, trans issues in general, nevermind "Oh they're just sending you mean tweets? Stop wasting our time" and downplaying/victim blaming the abuse. Even worse, their providers back them up (CloudFlare/Dreamhost). ([lordlicoricedrp](https://twitter.com/LordLicoriceDrp/status/1409948241085485057))
- Victim of what, exactly? Did someone on that website say "Let's fuck this person's life up!" or did they just post your name and then laugh? ([cheraldog](https://twitter.com/CheraldoG/status/1409674620882489348))
- I’m saying it’s unrealistic to expect anything else unless you want to do a mass censor of the entire internet. And at that point, you’re putting the power to do so in the hands of faceless, unaccountable corporations ([nostalgicnerd96](https://twitter.com/nostalgicnerd96/status/1409656434279649289))

- Hi not sure if you're aware but I'm getting a 522 error when I try to get onto Sage City (so the connection between Cloudflare and the SC Web Server timed out).

Thanks ([ismitetheice](https://twitter.com/iSmiteTheIce/status/1425671157580242948))

- Don't want Apple to scan your photos? Then don't upload them to iCloud.

- my website is down. I can't get signed in on your website. "Error 523 occurs when Cloudflare cannot contact your origin web server.

([thatsusanw](https://twitter.com/thatSusanW/status/1405234136353214473))
- Check your DNS Settings. A 523 error means that Cloudflare could not reach your host web server. The most common cause is that your DNS settings are incorrect. Contact your hosting provider to confirm your origin IP and then make sure the correct IP is listed. ([cj_reed](https://twitter.com/CJ_Reed/status/1405123015831179265))

In this case it's because the origin server is too overloaded, not because of plan limitations ([paultantk](https://twitter.com/paultantk/status/1397436618991050752))
- The CORS issue is probably caused by cloudflare error layer (rate limit error).. nothing much to do with the the backend code itself as we can see some people managed to load the date ppv/date listing at one point. ([eimihar](https://twitter.com/eimihar/status/1397433924150722561))

- That's correct. This is ONLY to prove there is a human there. So the human touches/taps the key/device/phone and they don't have to solve a CAPTCHA. Then they go to the next step, to create an account/login/post etc. ([nickbraak](https://twitter.com/NickBraak/status/1392894899100520454))
- Good question. This is a time-saving alternative to manually having to solve CAPTCHA questions to prove there is a person there and not a bot/script/process. It's not for ID verification, which security keys are generally used for. ([nickbraak](https://twitter.com/NickBraak/status/1392883302768517122))

- Right, so Cloudflare still gets to MITM the DNS traffic and if Cloudflare goes down, you go down. I'm glad you're considering other options. One of the main reasons for using a non-Cloudflare DNS provider is fighting against the single point of failure that is Cloudflare.

- Why does it no longer offer anonymity? Was it after changes were made before an update just before Operation Onymous, or the scripts that were running when set not to. If people log in with their details, their cover is blown. Most sites block Tor or give captchas. ([feelitworking](https://twitter.com/FeelitWorking/status/1388666066038046723))

- your email notifications page is the worst kind of anti-pattern. Do I click the checkmark to NOT receive updates?

- More recently it's been CAPTCHA. Now, I don't even mean places where it is even warranted or necessary. is notoriously bad for this on just about any website they reverse-proxy/front.

- Put the IP address in to your web browser, and, if they're using a shared host, you should get an error page identifying the host who you can contact to start regaining control.

I don't know if your CLoudFlare protection is too sensitive or your servers are too weak to handle the traffic. Please fix it. ([design4mind317](https://twitter.com/Design4Mind317/status/1373372524201967622))
- Today the CloudFlare gods have smiled upon me, and decided that every website I have to complete a captcha. Wouldn't be as bad if hCaptcha had any quality control. Say what you want about Google, but reCaptch at least worked. Isn't having gatekeepers to the internet great? ([jamescun](https://twitter.com/jamescun/status/1371918897839017991))
- Oh, that's changed. You used to be able to paste in the URL from any codepen editor page, but now Cloudflare gets in the way. Curiously, my Safari just hit the same Cloudflare page, but let me through after the CAPTCHA - never had that before (and I tried Safari before Flow). ([_piers_](https://twitter.com/_Piers_/status/1371492006258688000))

- Hey I am getting a 520 cloudflare error on your website. Are you undergoing maintenance or something? ([robinhyll](https://twitter.com/robinhyll/status/1372548633371967491))
- I think Cloudflare is great but its MITM approach is not very privacy-friendly, there are more privacy-friendly ways (for us) to provide security and reliability to our customers and users. We're probably a special case since we're very privacy-focused and a bit overzealous. ([ardewes](https://twitter.com/ardewes/status/1372149329092345858))
- I started using Cloudflare in 2015 because they offered free TLS certificates (back then a simple cert cost 100's of € per year), but obviated that need. Also, privacy is our main concern at so using a MITM service like became inacceptable. ([ardewes](https://twitter.com/ardewes/status/1372130942047895555))
- The FFN RSS/Atom feeds seem to be hidden behind Cloudflare CAPTCHA. This makes it ... rather impossible ... for my RSS feed reader to read the feeds. Can you exclude the /atom/ URLs? ([bob_vul](https://twitter.com/Bob_Vul/status/1372326154154110978))

([danialku](https://twitter.com/danialku/status/1370756451455565827))
- At some point I have actually attempted to put a fair amount of my own efforts into studying this sort of thing, and often I found that the choice of implementation CAPTCHA systems -- where often used in practice -- was largely avoidable but not completely.

- Using decentralized compute (ex Workers) to generate nonce can reduce compute times as cost. Nonce can be cached by SW. It is still unguessable for an attacker. A MITM attack could defeat this so hash based still useful. Or SW could rewrite CSP header at each load ? ([denistruffaut](https://twitter.com/DenisTRUFFAUT/status/1371704256311521281))

- Hosting your images and articles on seperate Cloudflare-protected domains makes your website a pain to use over Tor, requiring one to fill out a captcha to access the page, then going to an image manually to fill out yet another captcha in order to get images to load.

- This apparently affects all lynx users; I just tried from a system at my employer’s and a virtual machine I rent, and they all get a 503 error from when trying to access a site. This is catastrophic failure! ([knoblauchkeks](https://twitter.com/Knoblauchkeks/status/1340555669158637568))

- Cloudflare has already gone to the trouble of teaching users how to bypass error messages they see, why waste that time investment? 😂 ([yankeefinn](https://twitter.com/yankeefinn/status/1339741280075583491))
- When I right click on the page & click "Inspect Element" it shows I'm getting a 503 error that says, "Please turn JavaScript on and reload the page." But I have inspected NoScript and ensured that it isn't blocking JS. So it seems that the page incorrectly thinks JS is blocked.

- Captcha sucks when using a VPN! But understanding that some of your VPN endpoints, not all of them, are triggering Captchas on Google or Cloudflare hosted sites, you just change the VPN endpoint a few times until you get one that's not listed. ([johnny_doe2010](https://twitter.com/johnny_doe2010/status/1337279845990973440))

- if you are using a vpn service, or proxy, or a shared ip address, this can occur. I connect constantly via vpn and this error message is fairly common with sites hosted via cloudflare. Try connecting via a different service, wifi, coffee shop, whatever. ([planetdeception](https://twitter.com/planetdeception/status/1337698718875869184))
- If anyone facing with "Error 522" issue recently, please try with another domain when you got this issue. This seems a connection broken between Cloudflare - our server. ([9animeofficial](https://twitter.com/9animeOfficial/status/1337652570626486272))
- what happened to the site is just showing a cloudflare error ([alexlehm](https://twitter.com/alexlehm/status/1337557555384606722))
- HTTPS scan: should you enable it? What does CKTN has to say?! - Never enable HTTPS scans unless you need to (e.g. for ad-blocking) - Intercepting into HTTPS is basically a MITM like sing Cloudflare which gives them full control and in-sights into everything ([ckstechnews](https://twitter.com/CKsTechNews/status/1336487238012727296))
- Christ you’re thick. I recommend you talk to any pen-tester who will tell you that once that layer of encryption is removed — which they do — MITM’ing subsequent layers is trivial, i.e., unless they handshake (public key, etc.) was communicated out-of-band. ([kyleolbert](https://twitter.com/KyleOlbert/status/1329642529646653441))
- Depending on what you are doing it might be worth checking out as they offer SSL but will be a MITM, which is fine for many applications. Free also. ([rharpur](https://twitter.com/rharpur/status/1325552682241765378))
- It's extreme, but the threat vector isn't "MITM breaking TLS" - it's a misconfigured device that handles your TLS. For example, when Cloudflare or AWS ALB manage your certs, they can see everything unencrypted and in theory could leak data (like what happened to Cloudflare).

- Cloudflare gives me a bit of the heeby jeebies since their business is centered around MITM data flows. They do it to help, but it’s an unfortunate service to exist. ([mterhar](https://twitter.com/mterhar/status/1311049492016369669))

- Hi, I just failed cloudflare’s “are you a human” captcha bullshit 6 times in a row. Apparently I’m not human. So, if you’re following me or I’m following you, I’m clearly a bot. Or maybe cloudflare’s captcha has such shitty pictures that I can’t discern what the fuck it is. ([xenophage](https://twitter.com/XenoPhage/status/1334630205080662016))
- What does Cloudflare actually do when it's doing that, anyway? What is it checking? Why does it take so long? And why does it then make you do a captcha on top of waiting? Piss off with that. Just delete your website instead, assholes. ([catovitch](https://twitter.com/catovitch/status/1332091154825928712))

- Tbh with any new launch (Just like the Nvidia Launch, And Ryzen launch) the sites struggle. Maybe they need better hosting ;). But indeed the captcha is horrible, even on non launch days it's been a PITA for me. ([ryanteck](https://twitter.com/ryanteck/status/1329069258643390464))

- Yeah but, you gotta think about what people care about. I'll bet Google VPN doesn't make you do CAPTCHA Bet it's not blocked by CloudFlare Bet it's not blocked by Hulu/Netflix either People don't care about privacy. They just want the gibbs ([extraspecialk1](https://twitter.com/ExtraSpecialK1/status/1327898873616945152))
- Cloudflare Security/Firewall system is very bad. They block people who use shared IP address and ask humans to prove they are humans.. but it's worst than Google's CAPTCHA. Still I don't know how FREE CDN works, even Google is not offering something like that.That is why I say NO ([openspeedtest](https://twitter.com/openspeedtest/status/1326118476495220736))

- Hey Vishal, it looks like Cloudflare can't connect to your hosting account, which usually means the server your website is hosted on is down.

- Having weird issues with a site today. Started getting a Cloudflare error 1016 on LAN and on mobile data (not connected to network), but Gtmetrix, Pingdom and a TOR browser saw the site fine. Can't believe it would be a local cache issue since we saw an error on mobile as well. ([mattsingley](https://twitter.com/mattsingley/status/1301980453142892544))
- I tried that too, same results, still seeing error 1016 ([deluxetom](https://twitter.com/deluxetom/status/1301967551501488128))
- Not sure about Azure, but IIS log does contain this error. As said in the previous, the error was caused by Cloudflare sending an "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" in the proxied request. So the temporary solution is filter this header out until they fix at their side. ([seraphsx](https://twitter.com/Seraphsx/status/1301914513470640130))

- I have just installed elementor on a dedicated server - now says license could not be validated... yesterday i was seeing errors in their error messages - so my guess is that it's a poorly configured cloudflare setup ([jasonchargedm](https://twitter.com/jasonchargedm/status/1301573926326337538))

- Thank you, but I do not think this is the problem I am encountering- I am seeing the Cloudflare CAPTCHA page in my screenshot above when I am already logged in- I write a post, try to save draft, but it redirects me to Cloudflare page instead of saving my draft, losing my work ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297941070156832768))
- What settings do I need to change? Nothing has changed on my side to prompt this, this happens across browsers, and I have checked my IP address as listed on the CAPTCHA page on Project Honeypot as suggested Cloudflare community support and my IP is not blacklisted ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297929659049533443))
- Cloudflare has declared war on PIA's VPN It's captcha's every where I turn. ([gshinhwa](https://twitter.com/gShinhwa/status/1297310733458341888))
- How come your PhishTank is now delivering an invasive Cloudflare CAPTCHA to my browser? Cloudflare treats some ISPs like garbage. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1296835586402275332))
- Unfortunately, is too lazy and/or incompetent to use a real CAPTCHA system. Instead, they take the lazy way out and use the worthless reCAPTCHA. ([nickhillebran](https://twitter.com/NickHillebran/status/1296607396878524416))

- Cloudflare is a centralized MITM-type service which does not only have privacy issues, but nature is also detrimental to a free & open internet. Therefor it doesn't fit Linux IMO. ([stp_kitt](https://twitter.com/STP_KITT/status/1293299843037892610))
- Well, that is nearly exactly what happened to me and why I began this crusade against the BS policies of Cloudflare and lack of stewardship. They did not help me at all. Dozens of rogue sites stayed online scamming consumers after multiple abuse reports. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1296281227687854084))
- Wouldn't be surprised if they gave you an exemption to having to fill out those CAPTCHA forms. This goes back way before Cloudflare even went public. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1297323884014981137))

- I'm not sure what is going on but it seems like every site that i visit that uses your services keeps forcing a 'are you human' check.  That makes me close the tab and not even bother.  Is it a browser setting causing this ? or are all cloudflare this paranoid? ([csgeek](https://twitter.com/csgeek/status/1295141878942167040))

- When attempting to read messages from the API, I am receiving error code 1020? Google yields no results, outside of Cloudflare saying 1020 is Access Denied? ([thepackle](https://twitter.com/ThePackle/status/1293727554088710149))
- Bitdefender Central also does not work. It either shows a cloudflare error message or gets stuck and then returns you to the beginning of the login process AFTER you already logged in. I hope you guys did not get hacked. ([erjlem](https://twitter.com/erjlem/status/1293501465026334721))

- If Cloudflare truly believes in free speech, why am I blocked all of their corporate accounts? Why do they censor comments on their blog their critics? Why do they attempt to censor reviews on third party sites? Free speech when it serves them or is convenient. Anyway... ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1294431505268248576))
- This cloudflare captcha crap on Patreon when I’m posting an update is ticking me off. It says to prevent it make sure your computer is virus free. Mine is & it still gives me the captcha every time. I think it’s a ploy to DL a browser extension. ([karlkleese](https://twitter.com/KarlKleese/status/1294460722341191680))
- Great! Pls, get rid of cloudflare. Every hour captcha hell, no vpn or any proxy. ([aleonidovitch](https://twitter.com/ALeonidovitch/status/1294319107303768064))
- captchas makes it so I can't visit some sites now. Verify I am human but it doesn't refresh / forward to the site I'm visiting as expected. Manual refresh brings captcha again, often with none of what they are asking you to click on. Refresh on some sites work ([matrixglitch1](https://twitter.com/MatrixGlitch1/status/1290753303765286913))

- Michelle as a woman why do you allow revenge porn sites on your network and call it free speech? As a mother, why do you allow child porn sites on your network?

- Starting to find edge services such as cloudflare to be super annoying! Every other website keeps asking me to do captcha. The algorithms for detecting bot vs. human traffic are garbage: anyone using VPN for privacy is automatically considered a bot. ([echerng](https://twitter.com/echerng/status/1289924194365579265))

- I think Cloudflare is starting too have too much influence on the net. I'm hitting their captchas often when using sites. A friend was recently asked to install a browser extension after failing a Cloudflare captcha check, something which is a BAD idea to train people to do. ([zorinlynx](https://twitter.com/zorinlynx/status/1287460387957473284))
- Cloudflare blocks Tor, and although I can get your page to start loading filling out the captcha, scripts necessary to load beyond a white page are locked behind other Cloudflare-protected domains, making it necessary to fish them out and fill out the captcha on all of them. ([happysmash27](https://twitter.com/happysmash27/status/1286124765833580544))

- Cloudflare is responsible for a huge chunk of the internet and their business model is literally MITM as a service. ([kingslyj](https://twitter.com/kingslyj/status/1285457452306018307))
- This works situating the DNS providers’ nameservers behind a transparent DNS proxy Cloudflare is amazing. Convincing half the internet to voluntarily undergo a MITM attack. I've always assumed NSA + God knows who else has all (unencrypted) traffic going through CF. ([thesteedster](https://twitter.com/thesteedster/status/1286001305102815238))
- That's interesting, Cloudflare's captcha is an image, which screenreaders can't read, and there's no audio. Which potentially means people with eye-sight issues can potentially be cut off from half of the Internet. a11y ([vebbed](https://twitter.com/vebbed/status/1285707876150005760))
- StreamElements removed the CAPTCHA and is now throwing a 1020 error from Cloudflare when accessing the API. I'll throw up a stream tonight with Streamelements and what HTTP requests are being done to StreamElements when doing a TTS. Hope I can get a workaround from there ([sitopog](https://twitter.com/SitoPog/status/1285641898636595201))

- Hi. I keep getting pushed to a Cloudflare page on one of 2 laptops. On the other, I'm fine. On my phone, good too. But the Cloudflare push asks me to do through a Captcha and every time I try it, it will not go any further after I have done what I was asked to do.

- Thanks! The servers aren’t loaded much. Everything works fine if to disable Cloudflare proxying.

([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1275956834189393922))
- This is futile, trust me. If you find who's hosting, you contact the host. The host takes them down. They move to another host, which is easy to do. They're still hiding behind Cloudflare, so you can't find out who the new host is. Rinse. Repeat. RacistInChief ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1275943066042535936))
- Cloudflare doesn't have the power to censor. But can choose who they do business with. CF terminating a client doesn't censor. A website can exist / operate without Cloudflare, so the censorship excuse is a lame fallacy. You can't be against racism but still support racists.

He let's racists on his infrastructure but blocks critics. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1268004661564510210))

- Did you know a foreign-owned cloud provider has access to online votes on their way to the digital ballot box? When electors in Canada’s Northwest Territories vote online, their ballots pass through Cloudflare servers and are briefly decrypted while in transit. ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543023636897792))
- As a protection against denial-of-service attacks you can pay cloud providers to act as a kind of friendly man-in-the-middle. But protection comes in exchange for a high degree of trust: they need access to application-layer data to do things like inject fingerprinting JavaScript ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543026853941248))
- That means they have privileged access to see and change your vote. The legitimacy of the election relies on the assumption they won’t. They say the won’t, and so far we’ve seen nothing to contradict that. But how would you find out if they did? How do you know your counted?

- You mean you offload your problems onto legit customers using cloudflare to block every VPN you can find. Emailing isn't going to help, since I have no intention of surfing w/o one. So will start looking for a company that cares about customer security. ([CFSummers](https://twitter.com/CFSummers/status/1189941994170269696))

- If someone finds themselves wrongly blocked, they can't go to Cloudflare to complain because Cloudflare has blocked them from that site as well. So every day they sentence thousands of people to Internet purgatory because they got randomly handed an  IP address they blocked. ([random_interrup](https://twitter.com/random_interrup/status/1191798471914852352))
- Y'all need to dump Cloudflare. I'm blocked from your site without cause. ISPs randomly hand out IPs all day and I've inherited one they've blocked.

- The answer appears to be Cloudflare: the CAPTCHA-wall was theirs, and I'd recently looked at an unrelated site they host that was under their DDoS protection, so I bet that's why I was on the naughty list. ([xlerb](https://twitter.com/xlerb/status/1189530664606953473))

- I wonder if Google is funding Cloudflare in exchange for them to put their CAPTCHA on as many users as possible. Would make total sense google need users to train machine learning algorithms.

- Cloudflare's CDN isnt a DNS smartass. Cloudflare's only mission is to MITM the whole internet.  ([6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL](https://twitter.com/6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL/status/1158307042924408832))

- Cloudflare acts as a MITM. In other words, the client connects via HTTPS to their servers, not to the actual website, and then they connect to the actual server. They can read all traffic since encryption is terminated at their node. ([OtomaiShirona](https://twitter.com/OtomaiShirona/status/1159033822903787525))

Many errors on the main page after clearing out all site data  ([CoolApps45](https://twitter.com/CoolApps45/status/1156712382099591173))
- In truth Cloudflare's commitment to freedom on the 'net is clearly not true given Cloudflare's blocking of anyone who tries to connect to one of their client sites from a tor exit node. It's not about freedom. I doubt it's about any principles at all. ([DeborahPeasley](https://twitter.com/DeborahPeasley/status/1158124739933745152))
- If anything, Cloudflare is demonstrably against free access to information. Their entire business model comes down to locking off the Internet to all but the biggest tech giants (Googlebot), and denying any other Mom&Pop co’s in the name of “DDoS protection.” ([petebray](https://twitter.com/petebray/status/1158067340388401152))

- Well cloudflare is one of the worst companies out there.

- Looks like a Cloudflare issue. This is why I don't trust Cloudflare. So many people use it, which puts them into a position of being a gateway to information.

- You see, when the secure connection gets to Cloudflare, they do what is called SSL termination -- that means they end the secure connection so they can do a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

- Cloudflare is nothing you should trust. Also, using a different DNS than your ISP's default, you basically give away you data to 2 different companies instead of 1. ([6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL](https://twitter.com/6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL/status/1132391054165061632))

- Thought my Website was a Phishing Suspect, Cloudflare decided to force a Nasty Don't Enter notice on my E-store domain. No notifications to me at all! ([modaitalysuits](https://twitter.com/modaitalysuits/status/1122986421109682176))
