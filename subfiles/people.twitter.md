- Cloudflare is in the business of providing security services to hate sites, such as Kiwifarms. They are ultimately MiTM as a service and have created an unnecessary single point of failure for a lot of major, otherwise independent internet properties. Drop them. ([naiagoesawoo](https://twitter.com/naiagoesawoo/status/1415090179233050624))
- Weird, I’ve seen a seemingly random Cloudflare error pages across five very sites this evening. Each time a reload clears the problem. ([mhat](https://twitter.com/mhat/status/1415154967871057920))
- Your site is being blocked to users by in error, can you post direct links to sites people can use? Why is Cloudflare blocking all your content from sites posted on ? I can send screenshots if you want. I do actually want things from so quite annoying. ([feelitworking](https://twitter.com/FeelitWorking/status/1415111925273436162))
- Access to all the sites in the MSE Tips emails are currently being blocked by . You need to speak to them as they are effectively blocking your users, limiting traffic and business for advertisers in error. ([feelitworking](https://twitter.com/FeelitWorking/status/1415109098580946953))
- It was more a snarky comment that every site I visited today that was Cloudflare hosted had me do captcha first. Every time. ([brindy](https://twitter.com/brindy/status/1415804469959331845))
- Hey where do I send the invoice for my time spent training your Captcha AI? ([brindy](https://twitter.com/brindy/status/1415648542736138241))

- 12 hours and still no form. DNS error on CloudFlare ([boldranet](https://twitter.com/boldranet/status/1414544212570292225))
- I'm trying to log into WPEngine to investigate why Cloudflare are reporting errors for my clients' site, and I got a 520 error for the login page. Status page says all's good at WPE though? ([bekah_mcdonald](https://twitter.com/bekah_mcdonald/status/1414515358191529984))
- Seems that when I perform the query from a few address ranges I'll get an 'Error 1020' from cloudflare; for some reason from tor, of all services, the query is not being filtered... :x ([m0rb](https://twitter.com/m0rb/status/1413349732005654530))
- The JSON error is back and I'm triggering Cloudflare again lol. But at least this time we know where to look and take care of it. ([wpmainline](https://twitter.com/WPMainline/status/1412536190906023939))
- Tous les services qui utilisent un front/edge (Cloudflare, CloudFront, CDN,...) cassent le HTTPS et sont des potentiels points de collecte. De véritables MitM. ([a_ferron](https://twitter.com/a_ferron/status/1400380694027816963))
- I'm still experiencing Packet loss when using Cloudflare Dns. Google DNS works fine. no packet loss when using Googles DNS. ([kenneybear](https://twitter.com/KenneyBear/status/1409967204460814342))
- Using a service that appears to use Cloudflare. Intermittently the route will change and the service drops out, then 30mins-3hours later it changes back. Any idea why? Seems to route me to Syd, AUS from Perth, AUS. This is ISP independent. ([pantonious](https://twitter.com/pantonious/status/1414172503233110021))
- Web server is returning an unknown error There is an unknown connection issue between Cloudflare and the origin web server. As a result, the web page can not be displayed.

- has a really really fast VPN service. Now, allow me to choose the country/location I want to connect to and I will pay for it. ([gaichuhie](https://twitter.com/gaichuhie/status/1414325380857597955))
- Every time I see a javascript-requiring cloudflare MiTM page I get mad about the current state of the internet ([dustyweb](https://twitter.com/dustyweb/status/1413221353654734850))
- hi I’m trying to create an account but it’s coming up with a Cloudflare error message? Is the website down? ([seb_cheetham](https://twitter.com/seb_cheetham/status/1413060755491069958))
- I believe the topic was rather that DoH doesn't fix the privacy issue. You move the (dis)trust from your own ISP to some external party (usually Cloudflare) and their upstream. Same thing with VPN. You move the monitoring capabilities from your ISP to the VPN provider. ([dezestijn](https://twitter.com/DezeStijn/status/1412667780730699777))
- Lol, imagine this being something you complain about. "Oh no, I encountered a cloudflare captcha.." ([gigworkertrends](https://twitter.com/GigWorkerTrends/status/1412124325394718722))

- Is it me or is something wrong with your website? No images are loading & Cloudflare captcha keeps coming! ([9heavenin](https://twitter.com/9HeavenIn/status/1411793568188882946))
- Hi David - the page you're seeing is a Cloudflare CAPTCHA challenge. This may show if browsing from a private Safari window. Can you try to access the site outside of Safe Browsing? We've also passed this information along to our team to look into this on our end. ([linode](https://twitter.com/linode/status/1411129004606857216))
- ใครเข้าหน้าเว็บได้ แต่พอทำรายการ แล้วไปต่อไม่ได้นะ ทำตามนี้ ถ้ากดปุ๊บเด้งปั๊บรัวๆ ให้รีเน็ตเปลี่ยน IP ก่อน เพราะมันติด Cloudflare Captcha (ถ้าติดอีก ก็ทำเหมือนเดิม) แต่ห้าม ออก Browser นั้นเด็ดขาด เพราะจะต้องต่อคิวใหม่ ข้อมูลเทคนิคดูด้านใน เกษมราษฎร์ โมเดอร์นา ([tae9800](https://twitter.com/tae9800/status/1410810534925111297))
- It's really frustrating that I have to get through a Captcha process to login to your site - Any idea why? May be tied in with when I moved to (not sure) but it's frustrating enough for you to lose my business... ([pwatsonuk](https://twitter.com/pwatsonuk/status/1409977896165416967))
- Hi team, We can not use your site we tried with different devices and browsers and it seems that you set up firewall rule inside cloudflare to block AWS servers traffic. Can you check with your IT team and add our vpn IP 3.9.222.101 into whitelisted IP address. ([rim58543944](https://twitter.com/Rim58543944/status/1410264808507723784))
- Dear I do not want DoH, fucking ever. I do not want Pocket, fucking ever. I do not want your VPN. I do not want picture-in-picture controls. Fucking shit, I have my own DNS server, why the fuck would I trust cloudflare? Just make a version of the Tor browser but not ([xztpqkuy](https://twitter.com/XztPQkuY/status/1409662354644639754))

- Hey Marius I am getting a Cloudflare error when I try to access the link. ([jamesoregan](https://twitter.com/jamesoregan/status/1409516449136267265))
- Greetings. For weeks now I'm unable to visit the site due to a Error 1020 from Cloudflare. That's restricted just to the store, every other site on the domain is still accessible. What's going on? Is that a geolock of some sort? ([vinnycordeiro](https://twitter.com/vinnycordeiro/status/1409299360416940035))
- me: checks price of something on website "wait, wasn't it less than that an hour ago? are they bumping prices up based on tracking data?" me: opens tor to check cloudflare: "LOL AS IF, enjoy this 'hang on while we verify your browser' redirect loop for the next 10 minutes" ([gsuberland](https://twitter.com/gsuberland/status/1407356850199216135))

- I tried it again to get some better insights on the error, because to my surpise minting went through without having the full transfer in place because of the cloudflare prob ... I have not enough knowledge on the code, but my impression is that we miss some err handling here ([teriell](https://twitter.com/Teriell/status/1407436579107491843))
- Hi there we're having trouble adding a payment method for Cloudflare Teams. We've tried different cards. Same message: "An error occured while saving your payment method, try again." ([theciroma](https://twitter.com/TheCiroma/status/1407401859640397829))
- Today, I attempt to disable the Cloudflare security features on WP Mainline to see if that is the cause of the mysterious JSON error in the block editor. ([wpmainline](https://twitter.com/WPMainline/status/1407079633284177925))

- Yeah, still working on it. Got some Domain problems. Sorry. You getting a Cloudflare error? ([thegolddipper](https://twitter.com/TheGoldDipper/status/1406796729349984260))
- Possibly a gateway timeout from their backend api server, therefore cloudflare giving you one of their random error ids rather than human friendly error message ([nickevansdev](https://twitter.com/nickevansdev/status/1405816688554262529))
- Parece que habilitaron captcha de Cloudflare. ([tecnodragon](https://twitter.com/Tecnodragon/status/1405932766156492803))
- I've been trying to pass CAPTCHA but It seems all my selected images are wrong and I never get through this wall ([naveen_kashyapp](https://twitter.com/naveen_kashyapp/status/1405106934621954051))
- Dear if I can't see a website from your captcha crap, just because I use trackerblocking in my browser, maybe that website wasn't important. You should either just close your business or figure out something better. It's not the first time when this happens. ([christianbute](https://twitter.com/christianbute/status/1406526505044393985))

- I'm getting errors trying to access the dashboard. Looks like an overaggressive firewall. Your forums suggest people have been having problems for weeks.

- I'm getting an error from Cloudflare saying that your website is down ([mcarson75](https://twitter.com/mcarson75/status/1406331451319144451))
- Looks like a cloudflare error if they use cloudflare because LHR seems to indicate the London datacentre ([nickevansdev](https://twitter.com/nickevansdev/status/1405815997135790083))
- So python-requests kept getting the Cloudflare CAPTCHA page, but repeating the exact same request over a custom TCP connection was allowed through. Turns out urllib3 sets OPNOTICKET in its SSLContext, and the Cloudflare bot protection system Does Not Like that. ([gray69798502](https://twitter.com/gray69798502/status/1405828423923154946))
- According to data from Cloudflare, we spend about 500 years of our lives every day proving that we are not a robot. CAPTCHA has been with us for many years and we haven't come up with anything better at the moment Innovations technology ([biszop15](https://twitter.com/biszop15/status/1405784480745394176))

- getting Internal server error when trying to load DNS records. All good? cloudflare ([husainbasrawala](https://twitter.com/husainbasrawala/status/1405144121170436099))
- my website is down. I can't get signed in on your website. "Error 523 occurs when Cloudflare cannot contact your origin web server. This typically occurs when a network device between Cloudflare and the origin web server doesn’t have a route to the origin’s IP address. ([thatsusanw](https://twitter.com/thatSusanW/status/1405234136353214473))
- Check your DNS Settings. A 523 error means that Cloudflare could not reach your host web server. The most common cause is that your DNS settings are incorrect. Contact your hosting provider to confirm your origin IP and then make sure the correct IP is listed. ([cj_reed](https://twitter.com/CJ_Reed/status/1405123015831179265))
- All servers are with Linode in London, I don't know if something between your network and Linode London went down. ([amityweb](https://twitter.com/amityweb/status/1400399871912419336))

- So everyone touts being safe online. Use a VPN, they say… But it seems like all these companies that you would think want you to be secure, block your VPN with things such as Cloudflare. ([nurvdamage](https://twitter.com/NurvDamage/status/1404808636636053515))
- Yes, it seems the VPN I use has raised security red flags for many sites I've tried to visit. ([david__moser](https://twitter.com/david__moser/status/1404425072119410691))
- CloudFlare ofrece un servicio excelente a un precio inigualable. Pero... cómo? Por que en vez de con plata pagás con tu privacidad: les das un MITM a tus servidores. No gracias. ([notgoogled](https://twitter.com/NotGoogled/status/1403128128709578753))
- Cloudflare believes that there are better ways than CAPTCHA to prove that you are human online. ([trumpsystems](https://twitter.com/TrumpSystems/status/1404808669112541192))
- As Cloudflare I want to.. Use hCaptcha for my anti-bot product So.. The captcha will be broken all the time or, in best case, will be asking you to match some garbage images of boats, which are even worse than reCaptcha's, multiple times in a row, claiming you solved it wrong ([sominemo](https://twitter.com/sominemo/status/1404351296736538627))
- As a - website creator I want to.. - set a Cloudflare captcha on my website So.. - people on shared IPs with low reputation will be asked to solve a captcha every time on every single website multiple times a day before even accessing content ([sominemo](https://twitter.com/sominemo/status/1404350309443514368))

- 2/2 so I hit refresh enough to get back onto the site, the 3070 I had in my cart is out of stock. Oh, and the entire time I have to hit refresh every time I click something cause of the stupid Cloudflare error. Thanks for nothing ([ahobopanda](https://twitter.com/AHoboPanda/status/1403518296285143041))

- hi team, Since 7th June I started observing issues while logging into the cloudflare account. I am not able to recover the account. Tried all the relevant options available to recover. Can you please help me with it. I am not receiving a single recovery mail. ([ardhendu1508](https://twitter.com/ardhendu1508/status/1403615558587731970))
- You can try setting your browser DNS resolver to cloudflare to bypass this. Or a VPN like Proton's free tier. Free the science :) ([atomicnicos](https://twitter.com/AtomicNicos/status/1404099677658796037))
- It shouldn't be down, but we've gotten some reports of users getting a blank page in some regions. We think this is a cloudflare issue so investigating now. In the meantime, I think trying on a different device or with vpn may work. ([connextnetwork](https://twitter.com/ConnextNetwork/status/1403391276695838732))
- I guess that confirms Cloudflare as one of the 3rd party partners (that was my guess after the ODoH work). How it is toggled on/off? Can you tie specific apps to use it (like VPN with jumping through some hoops) ([mediumfidelity](https://twitter.com/MediumFidelity/status/1403178615710306306))
- Love your software, but have been getting a Cloudflare Error 523 trying to download the latest .23 update for about the last week. Please help! ([benfro6](https://twitter.com/benfro6/status/1403470671016046596))

- you clearly need to do something with your servers they are slow always so many errors so many that should charge you every time I see an data input error or the 522 error when cloudflare says host is down so for every error can I charge you 1$ as it's a delay ([nighthawk658](https://twitter.com/nighthawk658/status/1403376637735882756))

- Río Grande checking in. No power since 6:10EST. The power outage report button on the LUMA website has never worked since June 1st, 2021. Doubt from the DDoS.

- Cloudflare warning you for MITM attacks is actually the funniest thing ever ([__eater__](https://twitter.com/__eater__/status/1394628364388929539))
- Can check Cloudflare docs. Error 1025 is rate limiting because of plan limitations. Error 1200 is rate limiting because there are still too many requests pending from the origin server. In this case it's because the origin server is too overloaded, not because of plan limitations ([paultantk](https://twitter.com/paultantk/status/1397436618991050752))
- The CORS issue is probably caused by cloudflare error layer (rate limit error).. nothing much to do with the the backend code itself as we can see some people managed to load the date ppv/date listing at one point. ([eimihar](https://twitter.com/eimihar/status/1397433924150722561))

- This is a disaster. It is not achieving anything at the expense of something unnecessary. Please abort. Not everything is meant to be solved. 10 second CAPTCHA is fine we nailed it already. We waste a lot more on other stuff. ([mrrobot268](https://twitter.com/MrRobot268/status/1393140059478454279))
- For me the statistics are WAY LOW! "32 seconds" I spend 3 minutes filling out captchas on a good day. "1 captcha every 10 days." Try 10 captchas every day. But point taken! It's awesome you're trying something new. ([thesrcrr](https://twitter.com/TheSrcRr/status/1392912605396705280))
- Still breaking for me :( 520 cloudflare error ([_schism15](https://twitter.com/_schism15/status/1392866376142888966))
- not a bug, the Spanish government unironically blocked Twitch's sourcing server, we can't access the content because the server is blocked lmao Note: It appears to be a DNS block, therefore, simply switching to Cloudflare or Google DNS servers fixes the error. ([codingneko](https://twitter.com/codingneko/status/1392855522282545153))
- That's correct. This is ONLY to prove there is a human there. So the human touches/taps the key/device/phone and they don't have to solve a CAPTCHA. Then they go to the next step, to create an account/login/post etc. ([nickbraak](https://twitter.com/NickBraak/status/1392894899100520454))
- Good question. This is a time-saving alternative to manually having to solve CAPTCHA questions to prove there is a person there and not a bot/script/process. It's not for ID verification, which security keys are generally used for. ([nickbraak](https://twitter.com/NickBraak/status/1392883302768517122))
- So let's make thing more crap, and complicated, so that we get rid of captcha? This does not solve the bot problem, and does not help disabled people either. ([herrjemand](https://twitter.com/herrjemand/status/1392867746015322112))
- That's a Cloudflare error. Looks like they banned your IP. Did you do something naughty? ([bertelschmitt](https://twitter.com/BertelSchmitt/status/1392847840515280900))
- Right, so Cloudflare still gets to MITM the DNS traffic and if Cloudflare goes down, you go down. I'm glad you're considering other options. One of the main reasons for using a non-Cloudflare DNS provider is fighting against the single point of failure that is Cloudflare.

- Chances are you're running a VPN or something else which flags your IP to the Cloudflare protecting the government website. Not a lot of people need access to citizen specific web pages on Iraqi domains, hence the locked down nature to protect the websites from attack ([iraqbasic](https://twitter.com/IraqBasic/status/1390294780391804929))
- Baghdad government servers are rickety, incapable of withstanding DDOS attack (when an attacker intentionally overloads a website with automated traffic). Ministries won't pay for protection from services like Cloudflare, so requiring a captcha for all traffic is their solution. ([dmbenes](https://twitter.com/DMBenes/status/1390259870683877378))

- Moving our websites off actually made them faster for most of our visitors, contrary to their marketing. In addition, it eliminated the "man in the middle'", which helps us to better protect visitor privacy. Next up: Building an anycast network using our own IP space.

- 4) Tout l'avis du CE respose sur le stockage chez AWS. Mais rien ne mentionne notre prestataire préféré de Man-in-the-Middle as a Service (Cloudflare). Il y a aussi un accord de non transfert qui a été conclu ? Et eux en plus, ils voient le traffic en clair... ([gloupin](https://twitter.com/gloupin/status/1370454343053414409))
- gab is down. It's gone. Gab is behind the man-in-the-middle surveillance network Cloudflare and that service is responding to gab's domain with a message saying "The web server is not returning a connection. As a result, the web page is not displaying." Local power outage? ([bergvikjohnny](https://twitter.com/BergvikJohnny/status/1362973513611632641))

- Wow! Scary! What’s the impact of an invisible job done by a man-in-the-middle service provider??!😳 I actually did bump into pop ups by Cloudflare not knowing what was going on! Needless to say that Cloudflare has to take on responsibility!!! ([louisgeee](https://twitter.com/LouisGeee/status/1348259657966628872))

- Pelo amor de Deus, Não faz sentido ter o Cloudflare com captcha na api do GraphQL se vocês não vão tratar isso no front e vão pipocar mil erros de 403 pro usuário no console. Não consigo logar de forma nenhuma em nenhum dispositivo por causa disso. ([douglas_oaraujo](https://twitter.com/douglas_oaraujo/status/1379564383278407681))
- MitM is not enough for JS, though. The options are browser or thin client and browser-in-proxy a la Mighty or Cloudflare (but not just a blocking MitM proxy, a full transcoding proxy browser). ([brendaneich](https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1346394687079215110))
- Ja der Dienst von Cloudflare basiert auf MITM. Aber wo ist der Datenschutztechnische Unterschied zu einem Shared Webspace bei Strato, IONOS oder GoDaddy. Sehr typischer Lösungsansatz um eine Website zu betreiben. Und die bekommen auch den Traffic im Klartext ([th3_cr0wl3r](https://twitter.com/th3_cr0wl3r/status/1317409829665804288))

- Having to solve a CAPTCHA to view your API key when you're already logged in to your account with MFA active has to be one of the most ridiculous bits of security theater that Cloudflare has. Like, fuck off with that noise 🙄 ([sindarina](https://twitter.com/sindarina/status/1383380110238121989))

- More recently it's been CAPTCHA. Now, I don't even mean places where it is even warranted or necessary. is notoriously bad for this on just about any website they reverse-proxy/front. Why do I have to do this just to view a static public page served from cache? ([_rvklein_](https://twitter.com/_rvklein_/status/1380213523326861315))

- Put the IP address in to your web browser, and, if they're using a shared host, you should get an error page identifying the host who you can contact to start regaining control.

- Today the CloudFlare gods have smiled upon me, and decided that every website I have to complete a captcha. Wouldn't be as bad if hCaptcha had any quality control.

- Oh, that's changed. You used to be able to paste in the URL from any codepen editor page, but now Cloudflare gets in the way. Curiously, my Safari just hit the same Cloudflare page, but let me through after the CAPTCHA - never had that before (and I tried Safari before Flow).

- I think Cloudflare is great but its MITM approach is not very privacy-friendly, there are more privacy-friendly ways (for us) to provide security and reliability to our customers and users. We're probably a special case since we're very privacy-focused and a bit overzealous. ([ardewes](https://twitter.com/ardewes/status/1372149329092345858))
- I started using Cloudflare in 2015 because they offered free TLS certificates (back then a simple cert cost 100's of € per year), but obviated that need. Also, privacy is our main concern at so using a MITM service like became inacceptable. ([ardewes](https://twitter.com/ardewes/status/1372130942047895555))
- The FFN RSS/Atom feeds seem to be hidden behind Cloudflare CAPTCHA. This makes it ... rather impossible ... for my RSS feed reader to read the feeds. Can you exclude the /atom/ URLs? ([bob_vul](https://twitter.com/Bob_Vul/status/1372326154154110978))

- Using decentralized compute (ex Workers) to generate nonce can reduce compute times as cost. Nonce can be cached by SW. It is still unguessable for an attacker. A MITM attack could defeat this so hash based still useful. Or SW could rewrite CSP header at each load ? ([denistruffaut](https://twitter.com/DenisTRUFFAUT/status/1371704256311521281))

- This is totally irritating me, I cannot find a browser old/limited enough to get the captcha shown but new enough to connect at all (TLSv1.2) and render JS and the GUI CAPTCHA.

- For some reason Ugetube doesn't seem to let you connect through a VPN due to their Cloudflare config. I'm getting "Error 1020" Access Denied.

- HTTPS scan: should you enable it?

- Christ you’re thick. I recommend you talk to any pen-tester who will tell you that once that layer of encryption is removed — which they do — MITM’ing subsequent layers is trivial, i.e., unless they handshake (public key, etc.) was communicated out-of-band. ([kyleolbert](https://twitter.com/KyleOlbert/status/1329642529646653441))
- Depending on what you are doing it might be worth checking out as they offer SSL but will be a MITM, which is fine for many applications. Free also. ([rharpur](https://twitter.com/rharpur/status/1325552682241765378))
- It's extreme, but the threat vector isn't "MITM breaking TLS" - it's a misconfigured device that handles your TLS. For example, when Cloudflare or AWS ALB manage your certs, they can see everything unencrypted and in theory could leak data (like what happened to Cloudflare).

- Any cloudflare protected site will ask you for a captcha tho. When using the tor browser, that is not the case. ([kavin1337](https://twitter.com/kavin1337/status/1334537150713499650))

- Lol - yesterday i tested this type of captcha for the first time. Didn't get a single one right (without guessing + on mobile). "Privacy first" is cool and all, but i wouldn't trust my contact forms / shopping carts with this provider atm. 😑 ([der_abro](https://twitter.com/der_abro/status/1331931870125301761))

- Tbh with any new launch (Just like the Nvidia Launch, And Ryzen launch) the sites struggle. Maybe they need better hosting ;). But indeed the captcha is horrible, even on non launch days it's been a PITA for me. ([ryanteck](https://twitter.com/ryanteck/status/1329069258643390464))

- Yeah but, you gotta think about what people care about. I'll bet Google VPN doesn't make you do CAPTCHA Bet it's not blocked by CloudFlare Bet it's not blocked by Hulu/Netflix either People don't care about privacy. They just want the gibbs ([extraspecialk1](https://twitter.com/ExtraSpecialK1/status/1327898873616945152))
- Cloudflare Security/Firewall system is very bad. They block people who use shared IP address and ask humans to prove they are humans.. but it's worst than Google's CAPTCHA. Still I don't know how FREE CDN works, even Google is not offering something like that.That is why I say NO ([openspeedtest](https://twitter.com/openspeedtest/status/1326118476495220736))

- Hey Vishal, it looks like Cloudflare can't connect to your hosting account, which usually means the server your website is hosted on is down. If you're seeing it often and you want something much more reliable, drop a line - we can help! Hope that error goes away soon. ([skystracloud](https://twitter.com/skystracloud/status/1328754091103809537))
- Your Cloudflare for your site is setup badly configured - it is not allowing anyone to access your site - been on a revolving captcha / cloudflare / captcha for 15 minutes. You may want to have a look at it. ([jamjarchris1](https://twitter.com/JamJarChris1/status/1327575364382679040))

- Can I say can’t even given the chance to lock yourself out of accounts, because the cloudflare/google “oh no you seem to be using tor” recursive captcha loop from hell will consume you. ([synackpse](https://twitter.com/synackpse/status/1305184010893701121))
- or use Cloudflare to protect your blog and add a captcha to the contact form ([justmeddling](https://twitter.com/justmeddling/status/1301504201026084865))
- Yes, that's work and I know, that's not hCaptcha's issue. But when I pass the captcha, returns me again and again to that. I think, that is and problem with IPs. ([snosratiershad](https://twitter.com/snosratiershad/status/1299392330139660289))

- Have an RSS feed for your site. Use Cloudflare? Configure it not to throw a captcha on those URLs. RSS readers read RSS not hCaptcha HTML pages! ([ekes](https://twitter.com/ekes/status/1301536008035594240))

- it looks like your servers are down again 😔. I got a couple of "error 500" on Trakt, with the Matrix background, and now it doesn't even do that, it's 524 on Cloudflare (host timeout). I hope you can find the issue. Thanks! ([ajperez81](https://twitter.com/ajperez81/status/1303067590999379968))

- Having weird issues with a site today. Started getting a Cloudflare error 1016 on LAN and on mobile data (not connected to network), but Gtmetrix, Pingdom and a TOR browser saw the site fine. Can't believe it would be a local cache issue since we saw an error on mobile as well. ([mattsingley](https://twitter.com/mattsingley/status/1301980453142892544))
- I tried that too, same results, still seeing error 1016 ([deluxetom](https://twitter.com/deluxetom/status/1301967551501488128))
- Not sure about Azure, but IIS log does contain this error. As said in the previous, the error was caused by Cloudflare sending an "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" in the proxied request. So the temporary solution is filter this header out until they fix at their side. ([seraphsx](https://twitter.com/Seraphsx/status/1301914513470640130))
- This issue is from Cloudflare, nothing to do with Azure. (Although the error is from Azure/IIS) ([seraphsx](https://twitter.com/Seraphsx/status/1301891943673274371))
- I have just installed elementor on a dedicated server - now says license could not be validated... yesterday i was seeing errors in their error messages - so my guess is that it's a poorly configured cloudflare setup ([jasonchargedm](https://twitter.com/jasonchargedm/status/1301573926326337538))
- Error 520 sez Cloudflare. Must be getting lots of hits. ([cajunfj40](https://twitter.com/cajunfj40/status/1301520269174083589))
- Also think of what can do with all the data they currently MITM. Add the DoH query data to it and they also know about websites you visit that they don't MITM. ([kingslyj](https://twitter.com/kingslyj/status/1301859976093155329))
- Come on sort it out. Same as yesterday, dead on 14:30 BST Cloudflare error pages for most of the afternoon. Not a huge amount of use. ([nvelopuk](https://twitter.com/NvelopUk/status/1301153417310674955))
- tls1.0 et 1.1 c'est pas ultra safe en même temps, tl1.3 c'est pas top par contre mais bon c'est mieux que avoir un MITM via cloudflare ([ramleseam](https://twitter.com/RamleSeam/status/1300795041888243716))
- Then why do you use Cloudflare on your homepage and use it to MITM the login? Cloudflare does not abide by the DMCA. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1300557721536790530))
- The failing to save problem was the same as the Cloudflare problem I've been having (support ticket 915489, which I was told was escalated to the engineering team last week) but the Cloudflare CAPTCHA doesn't come up like it had and now I can't log in, which never happened before ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1301219981758267394))
- Yeah, its like the irony of using a "decentralized application" and receiving a Cloudflare error. Just wow. ([cryptocorral](https://twitter.com/CryptoCorral/status/1300666274951749632))
- including Cloudflare. Cloudflare’s systems routed around the problem, however, some Internet properties that use Cloudflare saw increased error rates during the impact period despite our mitigations. ([baselabubakr](https://twitter.com/baselAbubakr/status/1300377218707849216))
- 3 games had already concluded. All of us in india faced internal server error for about 2 minutes on chesscom including the players. If you go to cloudflare status site, you will see regiona affected due to this outrage. ([kunalkp87](https://twitter.com/kunalkp87/status/1300100199449206784))
- Ed, with all due respect.. 2nd round should have been played and then the appeal should have continued..today cloudflare also mentioned it was a global outage. A lot of us in India faced internal server error for about 2 minutes on chesscom.. ([kunalkp87](https://twitter.com/kunalkp87/status/1300084967255408640))
- It's a Lyric Round WiFi Thermostat. There's no reset wifi option in the app. I get unable to reach server error. I've had previous dm with my Mac address if you need it. Does the issue have to do with the cloudflare/centurylink outage? ([d3fung](https://twitter.com/d3fung/status/1300084527294033922))

- August 30, 2020. I cannot sign in either on the website, trying to reach the signin page simply returns a Cloudflare error page, and the ROKU SlingTV app is not working either. I assume that's also a signin problem. Just thought you'd like to know. ([bennycemoli](https://twitter.com/BennyCemoli/status/1300060622558769153))

- Yes, that's work and I know, that's not hCaptcha's issue. But when I pass the captcha, returns me again and again to that. I think, that is and problem with IPs. ([vharveyifa](https://twitter.com/VharveyiFa/status/1299392330139660289))
- how is it that I have to solve THREE captchas of and and again land on the captcha resolving page instead of getting the ORCID resolved? I cannot even access your main page. You should kick and out. ([rvb_siberia](https://twitter.com/rvb_siberia/status/1299174163698065418))
- Also using is nearly impossible with my suspicious Siberian IP address. I log in, clone or push a project - I solve a captcha. This breaks git command line tools, since about two weeks. How many hours per day am I supposed to solve ([rvb_siberia](https://twitter.com/rvb_siberia/status/1299171603432042496))

- I am currently unable to access your website over Tor due to an Error 1020 access denied error. Could you please reconsider your Cloudflare settings? Some of us like to browse the web without being spied on by our ISPs. ([happysmash27](https://twitter.com/happysmash27/status/1298149158990348288))
- Unable to login. Getting Error 1020 from CloudFlare. ([bluemint_io](https://twitter.com/bluemint_io/status/1297907064270774272))
- Thank you, but I do not think this is the problem I am encountering- I am seeing the Cloudflare CAPTCHA page in my screenshot above when I am already logged in- I write a post, try to save draft, but it redirects me to Cloudflare page instead of saving my draft, losing my work ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297941070156832768))
- What settings do I need to change? Nothing has changed on my side to prompt this, this happens across browsers, and I have checked my IP address as listed on the CAPTCHA page on Project Honeypot as suggested Cloudflare community support and my IP is not blacklisted ([quartzen](https://twitter.com/quartzen/status/1297929659049533443))
- Cloudflare has declared war on PIA's VPN It's captcha's every where I turn. ([gshinhwa](https://twitter.com/gShinhwa/status/1297310733458341888))
- How come your PhishTank is now delivering an invasive Cloudflare CAPTCHA to my browser? Cloudflare treats some ISPs like garbage. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1296835586402275332))
- Unfortunately, is too lazy and/or incompetent to use a real CAPTCHA system. Instead, they take the lazy way out and use the worthless reCAPTCHA. ([nickhillebran](https://twitter.com/NickHillebran/status/1296607396878524416))
- Nope, I don't use proxies or vpn, everything worked as usual but since yesterday I'm not able to access anything and sites using cloudflare give me that error ([finchnoise](https://twitter.com/finchnoise/status/1297215159145041921))

- Cloudflare is a centralized MITM-type service which does not only have privacy issues, but nature is also detrimental to a free & open internet. Therefor it doesn't fit Linux IMO. ([stp_kitt](https://twitter.com/STP_KITT/status/1293299843037892610))
- Well, that is nearly exactly what happened to me and why I began this crusade against the BS policies of Cloudflare and lack of stewardship. They did not help me at all. Dozens of rogue sites stayed online scamming consumers after multiple abuse reports. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1296281227687854084))
- Wouldn't be surprised if they gave you an exemption to having to fill out those CAPTCHA forms. This goes back way before Cloudflare even went public. ([dxgl_org](https://twitter.com/dxgl_org/status/1297323884014981137))
- i can't even access that site it gives me a cloudflare error orz. there was actually an entire twitter post with a proper translation for yurushii's interview going around at one point, i'll see if i can find the actual thread again ([yowainee](https://twitter.com/yowainee/status/1297600254326513665))
- Very odd, sorry I can't be of more help - it must be an error on Cloudflare's side. ([snappyhost](https://twitter.com/SnappyHost/status/1297258101184364546))
- Yipe...getting Cloudflare error 1016 when attempting to access Hopin. ([ccritt93](https://twitter.com/CCritt93/status/1296808860481654785))
- FYI. Cloudflare is throwing an Error 1016, Origin DNS Error for your site. ([thevakman](https://twitter.com/TheVakman/status/1296769235298013185))
- I'm not sure what is going on but it seems like every site that i visit that uses your services keeps forcing a 'are you human' check.  That makes me close the tab and not even bother.  Is it a browser setting causing this ? or are all cloudflare this paranoid? ([csgeek](https://twitter.com/csgeek/status/1295141878942167040))
- I keep answering 's CAPTCHA and it just asks me all over again. This is a scam. Do let bully you into using the CAPTCHA tool. This is soooo frustrating. ([muni_encinitas](https://twitter.com/muni_encinitas/status/1294452859522576386))
- love the early days of cloudflare getting popular when random static content would be captcha-walled ([puffyvolvo](https://twitter.com/puffyvolvo/status/1293340470635114504))
- cloudflare really annoying lately with a lot of servers requesting captcha checks constantly ([jokalido](https://twitter.com/jokalido/status/1292976406532698114))

- When attempting to read messages from the API, I am receiving error code 1020? Google yields no results, outside of Cloudflare saying 1020 is Access Denied? ([thepackle](https://twitter.com/ThePackle/status/1293727554088710149))
- Bitdefender Central also does not work. It either shows a cloudflare error message or gets stuck and then returns you to the beginning of the login process AFTER you already logged in. I hope you guys did not get hacked. ([erjlem](https://twitter.com/erjlem/status/1293501465026334721))
- My Patreon page is being weird because it throws up this questionable looking cloudflare captcha every time I click on something. ([elle_astrid](https://twitter.com/elle_astrid/status/1295423965909807106))
- If Cloudflare truly believes in free speech, why am I blocked all of their corporate accounts? Why do they censor comments on their blog their critics?

- This cloudflare captcha crap on Patreon when I’m posting an update is ticking me off. It says to prevent it make sure your computer is virus free. Mine is & it still gives me the captcha every time. I think it’s a ploy to DL a browser extension. ([karlkleese](https://twitter.com/KarlKleese/status/1294460722341191680))

- captchas makes it so I can't visit some sites now. Verify I am human but it doesn't refresh / forward to the site I'm visiting as expected. Manual refresh brings captcha again, often with none of what they are asking you to click on.

A friend was recently asked to install a browser extension after failing a Cloudflare captcha check, something which is a BAD idea to train people to do. ([zorinlynx](https://twitter.com/zorinlynx/status/1287460387957473284))

-  I just got 3 friends here in Germany to try - and NONE of them can gain access - they get blocked the same captcha. I'm thinking Cloudflare has Deutsche Telekom blacklisted, or some such. ([GrayanOne](https://twitter.com/GrayanOne/status/1200057914842587136))
- Just a friendly reminder that if your  Black Friday sales page requires someone to: check a Cloudflare “I’m not a robot” check box  solve a CAPTCHA image it’s probably not worth the discount. ([CoryJaccino](https://twitter.com/CoryJaccino/status/1199946959110443008))

- CloudFlare's website protection is blocking access to BitChute today. :/ Why not, they block other sites already! ([waynecolvin](https://twitter.com/waynecolvin/status/1197684878692667392))
- I've been wondering this myself. I've also considered that maybe these Cloudflare people, have taken away bitchute credentials in order to block them from public view. Maybe I should try to reach them on Tor Browser. ([AlarikOdinsson](https://twitter.com/AlarikOdinsson/status/1197684550446415872))
- Two months ago, I cancelled my Cloudflare account and told them to delete my data. Today, they've emailed me their new privacy policy because I'm still a customer! Trying to pump their user numbers up before an IPO or just sloppy data protection? Either way, not a great look. ([edent](https://twitter.com/edent/status/1179492594855874561))
- New blogging from me. Even after you delete your account, CloudFlare insist they have the right to email you per a non-existent section of their privacy policy. ([edent](https://twitter.com/edent/status/1197781221180411905))

- I love Tor, but too many sites are inaccessible when using it, thanks to CDNs imposing captchas on Tor connections, which don’t render properly because they all use Google stalkertech. Artificial creation of false ‘security vs privacy’ dichotomy. Looking at YOU, Cloudflare ([MissIG_Geek](https://twitter.com/MissIG_Geek/status/1189186672270819328))

- Their dns infrastructure just became a prime target for all intelligence agencies. And I think we can safely assume that NSA / Five Eyes will have, or allready have access to that data. With or without cloudflare's cooperation. ([HackyScientress](https://twitter.com/HackyScientress/status/1188161788619251712))

- If you’re in EU, the US can force Cloudflare to spy on you for them. At least your Dutch ISP only had to comply with warrants from a few countries. Worse, Cloudflare is the most juicy target for NSA/etc... they’re compromised. ([TheBlueMatt](https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1178029559737913345))

- Don't install Cloudflare's WARP VPN. This is NOT A VPN their own admission, and is a privacy MINEFIELD. This is a jaw dropping TOS, and I'm only a few paragraphs in. ([notdan](https://twitter.com/notdan/status/1178339685795598336))
- Did you know a foreign-owned cloud provider has access to online votes on their way to the digital ballot box? When electors in Canada’s Northwest Territories vote online, their ballots pass through Cloudflare servers and are briefly decrypted while in transit. ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543023636897792))
- As a protection against denial-of-service attacks you can pay cloud providers to act as a kind of friendly man-in-the-middle. But protection comes in exchange for a high degree of trust: they need access to application-layer data to do things like inject fingerprinting JavaScript ([aleksessex](https://twitter.com/aleksessex/status/1176543026853941248))
- That means they have privileged access to see and change your vote. The legitimacy of the election relies on the assumption they won’t. They say the won’t, and so far we’ve seen nothing to contradict that. But how would you find out if they did? How do you know your counted?

- You mean you offload your problems onto legit customers using cloudflare to block every VPN you can find. Emailing isn't going to help, since I have no intention of surfing w/o one. So will start looking for a company that cares about customer security. ([CFSummers](https://twitter.com/CFSummers/status/1189941994170269696))

- I recommend you stop 'just blocking' people for the hell of it. You've blocked my IP for no reason. You do realize that these IPs are handed out the ISP all day long and change often, or are you new to IT? ([random_interrup](https://twitter.com/random_interrup/status/1191785034547650561))

- If someone finds themselves wrongly blocked, they can't go to Cloudflare to complain because Cloudflare has blocked them from that site as well. So every day they sentence thousands of people to Internet purgatory because they got randomly handed an  IP address they blocked. ([random_interrup](https://twitter.com/random_interrup/status/1191798471914852352))
- Y'all need to dump Cloudflare. I'm blocked from your site without cause. ISPs randomly hand out IPs all day and I've inherited one they've blocked. This garbage directly impacts your business and shows how poor Cloudflare design is. ([random_interrup](https://twitter.com/random_interrup/status/1191798470585323520))

- The answer appears to be Cloudflare: the CAPTCHA-wall was theirs, and I'd recently looked at an unrelated site they host that was under their DDoS protection, so I bet that's why I was on the naughty list. ([xlerb](https://twitter.com/xlerb/status/1189530664606953473))

- I wonder if Google is funding Cloudflare in exchange for them to put their CAPTCHA on as many users as possible. Would make total sense google need users to train machine learning algorithms.

- Cloudflare acts as a MITM. In other words, the client connects via HTTPS to their servers, not to the actual website, and then they connect to the actual server. They can read all traffic since encryption is terminated at their node. ([OtomaiShirona](https://twitter.com/OtomaiShirona/status/1159033822903787525))

Many errors on the main page after clearing out all site data  ([CoolApps45](https://twitter.com/CoolApps45/status/1156712382099591173))
- In truth Cloudflare's commitment to freedom on the 'net is clearly not true given Cloudflare's blocking of anyone who tries to connect to one of their client sites from a tor exit node. It's not about freedom. I doubt it's about any principles at all. ([DeborahPeasley](https://twitter.com/DeborahPeasley/status/1158124739933745152))
- If anything, Cloudflare is demonstrably against free access to information. Their entire business model comes down to locking off the Internet to all but the biggest tech giants (Googlebot), and denying any other Mom&Pop co’s in the name of “DDoS protection.” ([petebray](https://twitter.com/petebray/status/1158067340388401152))

- Their abuse form is a joke and results in no action. ([phyzonloop](https://twitter.com/phyzonloop/status/1151831447554134016))
- It's scary to see how many websites are relaying on CloudFlare, and yet they go down pretty much frequently. They control the internet. ([OctolusNET](https://twitter.com/OctolusNET/status/1146056667424907265))
- Recent outages from Cloudflare and Google are a stark reminder that the internet is increasingly centralized and easily broken. ([CurtailInc](https://twitter.com/CurtailInc/status/1151613547283009536))
- Cloudflare is down more often than it's up on Charter / Spectrum. Oddly enough the DNS servers I shared a photo of work just fine & they too are anycast just like cloudflare. ([IanKoHoman](https://twitter.com/IanKoHoman/status/1151627555524489217))

- Ask why Cloudflare keeps on using Google’s reCAPTCHA when they can do their own.  ([rom](https://twitter.com/rom/status/1151423727629828096))
- Looks like a Cloudflare issue. This is why I don't trust Cloudflare. So many people use it, which puts them into a position of being a gateway to information. You have to go through them to get to your favorite site. The perfect climate for a marxist censorship takeover. ([Scarasyte](https://twitter.com/Scarasyte/status/1151604200754884609))
- i will sooooo block the sht out of TRR if mozilla makes it the default. to hell with whatever high value web properties cloudflare co-hosts it with. the internet is a _distributed_ system. dns is a _distributed_ database (and also autonomous.)

- You see, when the secure connection gets to Cloudflare, they do what is called SSL termination -- that means they end the secure connection so they can do a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. So any website you enter private information on, that uses Cloudflare, they get that info. ([cqwww](https://twitter.com/cqwww/status/1146117149297016832))

- Well, looks like Cloudflare is experiencing yet another worldwide outage. This happened precisely as I was sending out a huge mass email to my entire Medfuseio community, so they all ended up getting directed to a website with a 521 error.  ([iotmpls](https://twitter.com/iotmpls/status/1149013609390989314))

- I'm not sure how Mozilla DOH works, but if they are just teaming up with CloudFlare or Google, how does DOH enhances privacy?

- I just got a captcha starting a search on @crunchbase (Cloudflare name was on the page). It merely got me to press and hold a big button for 1s! Can't replicate for a pic now but both far less tedious and time consuming than this ml bs. ([RoryDHughes](https://twitter.com/RoryDHughes/status/1148699678785118210))
- Based on Cloudflare? A company that is US based and would allow intelligence agencies with nearly no effort to spy on all users at once? This is no enhancement.

- Earlier this week, Ecessa experienced the pain of the Cloudflare global outage when we couldn't access some cloud-based apps. It pointed out how dependent we all are on our SaaS providers and their infrastructures. ([Ecessa](https://twitter.com/Ecessa/status/1146450399098023937))

- Решил я как-то сделать выходную ноду Tor. Ну чтобы помочь людям анонимизировать свой трафик, а для себя возможность просматривать HTTP трафик.

- BTW hat Cloudflare einen riesigen Nachteil: Ist bei Verwendung von Tor durch unlösbare Captchas unbrauchbar. Man kann die Seite nicht anonym abrufen. Kann nach dieser DDOS Attacke zwar erwünscht sein, jedoch als Tor Nutzer, der einfach anonym ins Netz will, ziemlich ärgerlich.

- Cloudflare is nothing you should trust. Also, using a different DNS than your ISP's default, you basically give away you data to 2 different companies instead of 1. ([6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL](https://twitter.com/6JY6ZQVYS4p7YrL/status/1132391054165061632))

- Cloudflare is the NSA (effectively), so both proposals are about equal in their merits, but at least routing traffic through the NSA we reduce the number of hops, increase efficiency, and are more upfront and transparent with users about it.

([reykfloeter](https://twitter.com/reykfloeter/status/1075115190067347457))
