# Uncovering bad guys hiding behind CloudFlare


We believe in privacy for passive users of the web. But publishers on the web, as opposed to passive users who merely read pages, should be accountable. All CloudFlare customers are publishers, and many use CloudFlare because it encourages them to hide their original IP address. When they receive abuse complaints, CloudFlare resorts to diversions to pretend that they are acting responsibly â€” assuming that they respond at all. A refusal to embrace web accountability leads to cybercrime. That's why we use the term "CrimeFlare" to describe this company.

There are sites on the web that specialize in collecting registration and nameserver data. Several are serious research sites, while the rest are sites claiming that various domain names are worth big bucks in potential ad revenue, based on their traffic. Customers must change the nameservers on their registration in order to use most services. Each customer's domain is assigned two nameservers. This makes it easier to verify which domains depend on CloudFlare, and helps us keep our domain lists relatively current.
