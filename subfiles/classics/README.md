![](img/sher2.gif) ![](img/cfsign.jpg)


CloudFlare is a venture-funded startup that routes around Internet abuse by  
acting as a reverse proxy. They also encourage illegality by allowing hackers,
DDoSers, cyberbullies, and copyright pirates to hide behind their servers.
By 2015, CloudFlare was even [protecting websites](isis.md) that recruited for ISIS.
