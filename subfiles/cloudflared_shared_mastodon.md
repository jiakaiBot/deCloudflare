```
Mastodon is free and open-source software for running self-hosted social networking services. 
It has microblogging features similar to the Twitter service, which are offered by a 
large number of independently run Mastodon nodes (known as "instances"), each with 
its own code of conduct, terms of service, privacy options, and moderation policies.
