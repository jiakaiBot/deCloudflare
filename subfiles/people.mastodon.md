- MAS.TO users seem to be using some annoying bot that posts emojis at u if you post a link that has cloudflare trackers and it always tags a random a count with you when it replies and i dont know what it means but it looks really fucked up and bad ([geesehoward](https://monads.online/@geesehoward/107321285721237245))

- This is just a theory but hear us out. What if Cloudflare CEO, #MatthewPrince, is either connected to #JeffreyEpstein or exposed in the #InsuranceFiles protecting #Assange. In either case, having Prince as CEO of the #extortionRacket makes sense.

- Given that Epstein was trying to use #philanthropy in the #techSector and was funding startups, and university programs, and given the shared NewYork location, and given the connection to #wallStreet financing of which #Cloudflare appears to be an extreme beneficiary ‚Äî Its almost unfathomable that Prince and Epstein's paths wouldn't have crossed.

- There is so much great work out there do to. But then you realise #Cloudflare can just destroy any attempt to do great work ‚Äî it can even destroy a young, healthy athlete. Its sad to learn that #TorProject are hostile to people who speak up against Cloudflare. When we say #grants are slightly #toxic this is the type of thing we mean.

- Okay after a week with Plausible Analytics and knowing previous rough stats because I proxied my traffic thru Cloudflare for a while I can now safely conclude that JS based Analytics are impossible with my audience. I am kind of sad that I can't use Plausible because it is a really nice way to do privacy friendly Analytics but on the other hand I am a bit proud that I have the readers I do.

- We may've been too hard on #4Chan, #8Chan and #8kun. The reason we've been so hard on them is they helped create the #Christchurch massacre, don't federate, have prevented #Tor users from posting images, and hide behind #Cloudflare (so when they cross the line their service is not negatively effected). Having said that we understand why they might not be able to permit random Tor image uploads. In all fairness, we hope they ditch Cloudflare and try to be an open, #federating, Tor/I2P service.

- BTW, it's rather revolting that CBInsights wrote a 23-page report on FacialRecognition, but then they deny access to the report unless you supply them with an email address through their Cloudflare site. So in order to read about privacy abuses, you must allow them to invade your privacy. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106607795724189351))
- Another way to look at this: for every privacy-abusing walled-garden Cloudflare URL that appears among high ranking results, there is a privacy respecting result further down w/more merit that is denied visibility, which is more relevent to users who value privacy. Elevating Cloudflare sites to the top is not countering censorship-- it's just censoring something different. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106602899808080752))
- The flaw in your premise is the assumption that it's possible to visit a Cloudflare site without harming privacy. When you give traffic to a CF site, you inherently undermine privacy by feeding privacy abusers, normie or not, defensive tools or not. When you support a privacy abuser, you are deciding for everyone that the abusive site is worthy of existence. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106602603375567450))
- Some of your articles make it clear that you're aware of Tor, and yet you pimp ReadTheDocs, a privacy-abusing & exclusive Tor-hostile service that forces those who want to access documentation into Cloudflare's walled-garden. Plz consider reversing that. Plz tell your readers that Cloudflare is socially harmful & write your guide to show people how to avoid RTD. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106596045466887566))
- A down moment does not count as "breaking the Internet". But when a CDN's policy causes it to non-stop deny service to various classes of users, like Cloudflare does, that is most certainly "breaking the Internet". Now get the spotlight off Fastly and put it back on Cloudflare where it belongs. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106564470267665771))
- I've heard someone complain that they get Cloudflare CAPTCHAs all over the place b/c of being behind CGNAT, so I assumed it was everyone. Perhaps it only happens if someone in your IP pool runs a bot on CF sites. It would be interesting to have some statistics on this. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106540159094379036))
- I really appreciate all your feedback. I'm trying to get an idea of Cloudflare's impact beyond Tor & apparently ppl in Russia, Serbia, Poland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Philippines, & India all must be getting CAPTCHA at an unbearable frequency due to CGNAT, correct? ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106539623255475244))
- if "pack your stuff" & "walk away" is a metaphor for boycott Cloudflare, that's indeed what I do. I boycott all of MACFANG. But this is not about me; it's about switchingSoftware, who is betraying their readers by lying to them about the openness of the Cloudflare site that they endorse & by concealing the pitfalls which directly contradicts the SWISO mission. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106517895846430965))
- A blind claim that Tor is only convenient in "outdated" protocols is unfounded. Which modern protocols are you saying Tor is inconvenient or sluggish for? Cloudflare being "here to stay" is very poor rationale for supporting Cloudflare. Amazon, Google, Facebook, & Microsoft are also here to stay but this does not justify empowering them. It does not justify swiso lying to ppl. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106517859440281010))

- One thing that people tend to despise is that Cloudflare doxxed a child abuse whistle blower. That is, someone reported an offending CF site to CF, and CF then disclosed their identity to the site owner, who then published it so users of that site could retaliate.

- Avoid Libera.chat's web chat folks-- it's a privacy abusing Cloudflare site with exclusive access restrictions (so it's a walledgarden). ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500771150474833))
- Wire has shortcomings for sure. XMPP is great for advanced users. Matrix caters for novices IIUC but Cloudflare has a role that screams run away. Element.io is a Cloudflare site. It's avoidable (thanks fdroid!) but it's a big red flag that the people behind it are not on the ball & so it should be approached w/great caution b/c incompetency can manifest in other ways. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500007882984472))
- It's actually a netneutrality problem for MS & Google to block on the basis of IP address, because that policy creates access inequality. It's comparable to what Cloudflare is doing to Indians & Serbians, whereby they force users of cheap ISPs (which use CGNAT) to solve CAPTCHA. Those users must pay a fee to get the privs of IPv4 or IPv6. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106495857763772189))
- matrix uses Cloudflare for some of their web stuff so i've not looked further into it. I should mention that Jami can be used asynchronously, but it's not straight forward.. someone at one end has to run their own server for it to work. So indeed it's still impractical for novice-to-novice async comms. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106495402820022110))
- In this case, it's people in Serbia & India who buy the cheapest possible residential Internet connections from ISPs that use CGNAT & charge extra for IPv4 or IPv6. Cloudflare blocks them by default, & ReadTheDocs maintains those dicriminatory settings, which are the gatekeepers of Linux Mint docs.

- And Visa is even more reckless than Mastercard, as in exposes your card to CloudFlare, who can link that to ~30% of what CF sees in your web traffic (your identity under a microscope).

It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy. I hope that affordable CDN and DDOS protection alternatives will grow and vanish CloudFlare in the end. ([Ajz](https://mastodon.host/@Ajz))

Paying for that service is even more ridiculous from any sane perspective.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/e3a57b9a-a80d-4d2b-a44f-de8b166dba00))

- Cloudflare and Google captcha are the worst enemies of tor. ([lexa](https://mstdn.io/@lexa/103356277680824722))
- BTW, it doesn't matter who your CA is, the tunnel between outsiders & CF's site always terminates at CF.  So, for example, if you were a mastodon.social user, CF would see your username & unhashed pw full stop. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359038780017782))
- CloudFlare blocks from the reader's side, not the author.  If Alice blogs on a CF site then Bob is blocked from reading it if CF objects to Bob's IP address-browser pair.  And that's not theoretical -- it's certain. CF dictates who can reach who.  CF also pushes surveillanceCapitalism via a forced Google-served CAPTCHA (depending on IP-browser pair).  Using a CF service gives them power.  Twentyfivebux unwittingly supports centralization & empowers CF by using mastodon.social. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103358978513641848))
- Sure there are many instances.  Some are respecting of freedom & privacy, and some are not.  CloudFlare is an abuser of privacy & netneutrality.  You've specifically endorsed a CF node (mastodon.social). As a privacy foundation, you should know better and you should set a better example. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359630910309671))
-  CloudFlare sites like mastodon.social are profoundly stupid choices to endorse. Even if you neglect the Tor hostility & VPN weakness, CF still sees all traffic.  Also, using CF feeds a privacy abuser financially, which works against your alleged cause.  ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359717636003316))
- I'm more concerned with Clouflare's dominance (~75% of high-traffic websites on internet) regarding caching HTTPS in exchange for website owners private keys (in effect silently compromising  all visitors to said sites as well). After digging into Cloudbleed and the technical solution at Cloudflare making this security bug possible, along with their transparency  (www.cloudflare.com/transparency/), it became apparent that this is the biggest orchestrated HTTPS weakness out there serving US government.

- On a more serious note, I know a lot of people believe using Cloudflare automagically makes their site more secure because of the green lock indicating that fact. I can understand it more for people using crappy webhosts that you can't get certs from Let's Encrypt with. For people who run their own servers, there is no excuse for putting CF in the middle and giving them access to all their users' traffic. It's just stupid.

- Security: every site that uses it, Cloudflare is a proxy that intercepts all the traffic. It can therefore correlate individual user traffic across every site that uses/embeds cloudflare site/resources. Single point of security failure, from a global surveillance point of view. Usability: If you're a Tor user, it makes a huge part of the Internet unbearable because it constantly injects captchas to view sites every couple minutes, to block abuse.

Noch dazu ein Dienst, der auf den meisten Seiten Tor blockiert. Fehler hin oder her ... Wer Datenschutz ernst nimmt, verzichtet auf Cloudflare und √§hnliche Dienste. Und wer doch einen Proxy vor seinem eigentlichen Dienst brauch, kann ihn ja selbst aufsetzen. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102372968538354130))
