- @bitcoinmagazine good, now they just have to get rid of #Cloudflare. ([pamaca](https://descentraliza.me/objects/9ad4c868-1673-4285-8050-0f47bb684b48))
- getting really tired of the cloudflare endless refresh loops ([shmibs](https://tomo.airen-no-jikken.icu/objects/cf9c602f-669e-4c15-b97f-1888ae3f5632))
- What stops #Cloudflare from making purchases on #cryptoExchanges they control, assuming the #moneyPrinter? Is it just ethics or could they be waiting for something. For example, when #bitcoinAdoption is at its peak and there's a lot of peoples' #savings on #onlineExchanges? Are they waiting for an order from #Biden to seize crypto on #exchanges? That is, an #FDR-style #confiscation, but of #bitcoin rather than #gold being taken? Almost all #bitcoin exchanges are Cloudflare.

- I just wanted to sign up for one of those meal delivery box services because I got a coupon code in the mail. It gave me a Cloudflare error, and did not allow me to sign up. That makes me leery of using it anyway, since Cloudflare is well known for previously hosting 8chan, and as far as I know still supports Kiwifarms? Anyway I tried another one and their sign up page just showed a constant spinning circle and never advanced past it. What the fuck is wrong with these companies? ([the_t](https://glaceon.social/@The_T/106925543938230003))

- Of course, the big difference between the game Monopoly and Cloudflare is the addition of the #data. Your data is fixed, you only have 200 units of data and once they go into someone's #takenPile they can never go into the #soulPile, even if you take back your own data at a later time. Once your data is gone its gone. Most people will want to hold onto there data for as long as possible. But not at the expense of losing all their money and being unable to buy #bases/#servers.

- Re are not fans of everything #China are doing by a long shot, but the #PeoplesParty seem to identify the issues of #monopoly and enforce rules with impactful fines, and block moves that would entrench the #monopoly.

- well they've obviously pirated Cloudflare's block page, which they wield against Tor users, so it's the same problem. It's a Tor-hostile walled-garden. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106660251961822091))
- A few years ago, Cloudflare went down... a few months ago, Fastly went down... today, Akamai went down...God, I love how people are just not learning anything from the past :^)I'm just gonna say it...The next major web outage will be caused by either CloudFront, cdnjs or JSDelivr.

- BTW, it's rather revolting that CBInsights wrote a 23-page report on FacialRecognition, but then they deny access to the report unless you supply them with an email address through their Cloudflare site. So in order to read about privacy abuses, you must allow them to invade your privacy. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106607795724189351))
- Another way to look at this: for every privacy-abusing walled-garden Cloudflare URL that appears among high ranking results, there is a privacy respecting result further down w/more merit that is denied visibility, which is more relevent to users who value privacy. Elevating Cloudflare sites to the top is not countering censorship-- it's just censoring something different. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106602899808080752))
- The flaw in your premise is the assumption that it's possible to visit a Cloudflare site without harming privacy. When you give traffic to a CF site, you inherently undermine privacy by feeding privacy abusers, normie or not, defensive tools or not. When you support a privacy abuser, you are deciding for everyone that the abusive site is worthy of existence. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106602603375567450))
- Some of your articles make it clear that you're aware of Tor, and yet you pimp ReadTheDocs, a privacy-abusing & exclusive Tor-hostile service that forces those who want to access documentation into Cloudflare's walled-garden. Plz consider reversing that. Plz tell your readers that Cloudflare is socially harmful & write your guide to show people how to avoid RTD. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106596045466887566))
- A down moment does not count as "breaking the Internet". But when a CDN's policy causes it to non-stop deny service to various classes of users, like Cloudflare does, that is most certainly "breaking the Internet". Now get the spotlight off Fastly and put it back on Cloudflare where it belongs. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106564470267665771))
- I've heard someone complain that they get Cloudflare CAPTCHAs all over the place b/c of being behind CGNAT, so I assumed it was everyone. Perhaps it only happens if someone in your IP pool runs a bot on CF sites. It would be interesting to have some statistics on this. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106540159094379036))
- I really appreciate all your feedback. I'm trying to get an idea of Cloudflare's impact beyond Tor & apparently ppl in Russia, Serbia, Poland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, Philippines, & India all must be getting CAPTCHA at an unbearable frequency due to CGNAT, correct?

- if "pack your stuff" & "walk away" is a metaphor for boycott Cloudflare, that's indeed what I do. I boycott all of MACFANG. But this is not about me; it's about switchingSoftware, who is betraying their readers by lying to them about the openness of the Cloudflare site that they endorse & by concealing the pitfalls which directly contradicts the SWISO mission. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106517895846430965))
- A blind claim that Tor is only convenient in "outdated" protocols is unfounded. Which modern protocols are you saying Tor is inconvenient or sluggish for? Cloudflare being "here to stay" is very poor rationale for supporting Cloudflare. Amazon, Google, Facebook, & Microsoft are also here to stay but this does not justify empowering them. It does not justify swiso lying to ppl. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106517859440281010))

- One thing that people tend to despise is that Cloudflare doxxed a child abuse whistle blower. That is, someone reported an offending CF site to CF, and CF then disclosed their identity to the site owner, who then published it so users of that site could retaliate. When Matthew Prince (the CEO) was confronted about it, he said the whistle blower "should have used a fake name". ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106501447385521089))
- Avoid Libera.chat's web chat folks-- it's a privacy abusing Cloudflare site with exclusive access restrictions (so it's a walledgarden). ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500771150474833))
- Wire has shortcomings for sure. XMPP is great for advanced users. Matrix caters for novices IIUC but Cloudflare has a role that screams run away. Element.io is a Cloudflare site. It's avoidable (thanks fdroid!) but it's a big red flag that the people behind it are not on the ball & so it should be approached w/great caution b/c incompetency can manifest in other ways. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500007882984472))
- It's actually a netneutrality problem for MS & Google to block on the basis of IP address, because that policy creates access inequality. It's comparable to what Cloudflare is doing to Indians & Serbians, whereby they force users of cheap ISPs (which use CGNAT) to solve CAPTCHA. Those users must pay a fee to get the privs of IPv4 or IPv6. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106495857763772189))
- matrix uses Cloudflare for some of their web stuff so i've not looked further into it. I should mention that Jami can be used asynchronously, but it's not straight forward.. someone at one end has to run their own server for it to work.

- In this case, it's people in Serbia & India who buy the cheapest possible residential Internet connections from ISPs that use CGNAT & charge extra for IPv4 or IPv6. Cloudflare blocks them by default, & ReadTheDocs maintains those dicriminatory settings, which are the gatekeepers of Linux Mint docs.

- And Visa is even more reckless than Mastercard, as in exposes your card to CloudFlare, who can link that to ~30% of what CF sees in your web traffic (your identity under a microscope).

- The election system is broken in terms of privacy. Citizens are forced to decide: 1) give up the right to vote, or 2) share their physical address with the state, who will then publish it for anyone to access. On top of that, 8 states now force all voters to share the public info + their SSN or DL with CloudFlare Inc.I think Alaska is the only state sensible enough to give voters a way to keep their physical address private. by [aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/104304629350973064))

- they've censored LGBT resources under sexual content with their DNS scheme, they harass tor users with captchas to access almost all their websites by default, which pins tracking information to you in an attempt to deanonymize you (Its s Google Captcha, what do you expect). They've consolidated a large part of the web and its traffic under their control and undermine the idea that encrypted web connections should be going directly to a site, untampered with.So if you're a large company with a stranglehold on internet traffic, the ability to track users, and view the unencrypted contents of their connections, what do you think is an obvious way to profit?Don't trust CloudFlare.

- Today first I successfully did a search on opensubtitles.org with Firefox and noticed that this site uses CloudFlare. Then later on I tried to do a search on opensubtitles.org with the Tor browser. I got the Google ReCaptcha, and after solving that for more than 10 to 15 times, where it seemed to give me access a few times, I was still not able to perform a search at all (meh) :_catsad: When will people realize that the free of charge for 1 website DDOS protection by CloudFlare is not at all a cool and free option to choose for. It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy. I hope that affordable CDN and DDOS protection alternatives will grow and vanish CloudFlare in the end. ([Ajz](https://mastodon.host/@Ajz))
- If you're at a small scale, why would you pretend you need the services that CloudFlare provides in the first place? I understand that people watching MSM and have little knowledge of IT will think that everyone in the world is constantly being DDoSed every time they make a post on their blog, but that's just not the case.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/0e1fe9a1-1099-4091-899b-69130f309a6e))
-  I understand the marketing team has a lot of other functionalities that you can list in order to make it look less bad, but you're still doing all your users a massive disservice by employing CloudFlare inbetween them and your service. No matter how many cool features you think you're getting for gratis, you're still handing all your customer data to them, essentially through having them become the middle man of the man in the middle scheme. Paying for that service is even more ridiculous from any sane perspective.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/e3a57b9a-a80d-4d2b-a44f-de8b166dba00))

- BTW, it doesn't matter who your CA is, the tunnel between outsiders & CF's site always terminates at CF.  So, for example, if you were a mastodon.social user, CF would see your username & unhashed pw full stop. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359038780017782))
- CloudFlare blocks from the reader's side, not the author.  If Alice blogs on a CF site then Bob is blocked from reading it if CF objects to Bob's IP address-browser pair.  And that's not theoretical -- it's certain. CF dictates who can reach who.  CF also pushes surveillanceCapitalism via a forced Google-served CAPTCHA (depending on IP-browser pair).  Using a CF service gives them power.  Twentyfivebux unwittingly supports centralization & empowers CF by using mastodon.social. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103358978513641848))
- Sure there are many instances.  Some are respecting of freedom & privacy, and some are not.  CloudFlare is an abuser of privacy & netneutrality.  You've specifically endorsed a CF node (mastodon.social). As a privacy foundation, you should know better and you should set a better example. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359630910309671))
-  CloudFlare sites like mastodon.social are profoundly stupid choices to endorse. Even if you neglect the Tor hostility & VPN weakness, CF still sees all traffic.  Also, using CF feeds a privacy abuser financially, which works against your alleged cause.  ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359717636003316))
- I'm more concerned with Clouflare's dominance (~75% of high-traffic websites on internet) regarding caching HTTPS in exchange for website owners private keys (in effect silently compromising  all visitors to said sites as well). After digging into Cloudbleed and the technical solution at Cloudflare making this security bug possible, along with their transparency  (www.cloudflare.com/transparency/), it became apparent that this is the biggest orchestrated HTTPS weakness out there serving US government.

- On a more serious note, I know a lot of people believe using Cloudflare automagically makes their site more secure because of the green lock indicating that fact. I can understand it more for people using crappy webhosts that you can't get certs from Let's Encrypt with. For people who run their own servers, there is no excuse for putting CF in the middle and giving them access to all their users' traffic. It's just stupid.

It can therefore correlate individual user traffic across every site that uses/embeds cloudflare site/resources. Single point of security failure, from a global surveillance point of view.

- Google reCaptcha nicht erreichbar? ... Na dann viel Spaß in der Hölle, freunde von Cloudflare ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102543497886371728))
- the internet is a huge place even once you disable javascript and many websites stop working, and you use tor so the greatcloudwall auto-blocks you. ([jeffcliff](https://niu.moe/@jeffcliff/101894104472506869))
-  Ich surf inzwischen fast ausschließlich über TOR. Außer bei Betreibern, denen ic traue. Deswegen hab ich so oft ärger mit CloudFlare. Nur wenige machen es z.B. wie nipos und deaktivieren den TOR Schutz. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102501955975549073))
- na klasse. Noch so eine deutsche Firma, die glaubt, der Datenschutz sei gewährleistet, wenn man den kompletten Traffic durch einen proxy in den USA leitet. Also das Linux Magazin, nicht tuxedocomputers)
- Man könnte echt meinen, die deutschen könnten ohne Cloudflare nicht mehr leben  ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102501662983987631))
- This is a good example why it is bad to rely on cloudflare in masses. It felt like the internet was dying for a minute there. ([SolSoCoG](https://ieji.de/@SolSoCoG/102372262422393175))
- kann mir sicher beantworten, in wie weit Cloudflare mit dem deutschen Datenschutz vereinbar ist, wenn man eine Homepage hinter deren Proxy Server versteckt, deren Standorte in den USA liegen? Und wie muss Cloudflare in dem Fall in der Datenschutzerklärung angegeben sein? ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102497051015883486))
- Wir haben also eine „ethical hacker“ Zertifizierung von der NSA beworben und CloudFlare auf einer Seite. Was sagt uns das also über CloudFlare aus? Für mich persönlich sieht das so aus, als würde CloudFlare die Daten direkt zur NSA weiter leiten ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102462408957007477))
- Das Linux Magazin nennt die Nutzung der CloudFlare Reverse-Proxy Server als CDN ... Wenn das CDN ist, was ist dann das Ausliefern einzelner Dateien über einen extra Server?)
- CloudFlare kann echt bald von jedem ein Bewegungsprofil erstellen, dagegen sind die Fahrzeuge von Google Maps ein scheiß ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102475706977537396))
- Lustig, wie selbst INWX in ihren Datenschutzerklärungen in keinster Weise CloudFlare erwähnt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102474883800543138))
- It's because cloudflare actively spies on traffic going through it, so any service connected to it is compromised by default. Even if the service itself is well-meaning and wants to respect privacy, just having cloudflare there ruins all of it. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102457243116505761))
- Cloudflare had a unchecked regex expression they rolled out to live service without testing and it broke half the Internet. ([Bluedepth](https://mastodon.technology/@Bluedepth/102457244936687401))
- Wenn ich mir die Möglichkeiten ansehe, die ich mit nginx habe, Log Dateien zu schreiben, läuft mir echt ein eiskalter Schauer über den Rücken,weil ich mir ausmalen kann,welchen Preis Besucher von Webseiten hinter Cloudflare Proxy Servern bezahlen. Wenn ich das ganze dann hoch rechne...Die könnten ein komplettes bewegungsprofil eines jeden erstellen. Und Google wird durch das Captcha direkt mit gefüttert.)
- Ich als Anbieter könnte echt nicht mit dem Gewissen leben,meine Besucher so zu verkaufen ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102458133671163498))
- Mit Serverstandort Deutschland zu werben, nutzt einen scheißdreck, wenn man den Server hinter den USA Proxys von CloudFlare versteckt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102457750251926436))
- Really disappointed and a little disgusted by the Matrix team. Putting Cloudflare spyware on their main instance, forcing every user to either go through the malicious wall or to use a homeserver that doesn't federate with matrix.org thus cutting itself off from just about everything. Will be giving XMPP a go today. Wonder if that community has even the tiniest bit of respect for users. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456355379841384))
- Even the main instance uses Cloudflare. New users will probably just use the main instance for convenience. ([RMW](https://linuxrocks.online/@RMW))
- I use to think it was cool that you can pay a little bit and have your own instance but it sucks that they put every instance behind Cloudflare. ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/101918685210269597))
- Don't laugh when cloudflare says “the network is the computer.” They mean surveillance and they mean the surveillance goes all the way to the endpoints. Boycott them and their nefarious agenda. ([roy](https://pleroma.site/objects/1ddf444d-0f2c-4d0d-bc11-e06f28efd5bc))
- I think I've found an alternative to Cloudflare Liberapay. I'm going to set Fosspay up this evening and start replacing Liberapay links on my website ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102436150784521976))
- I'm sad that the Crimeflare got deleted because they'd be having a field day today. cloudflare ([DashEquals](https://ap.torlipen.net/objects/5f1b65fc-499d-4312-b20e-7b0cb9dd7ee2))
- All I want is a privacy respecting messaging platform that does group conversations and voice chat, does that *really* have to be a big ask? Been really put off Matrix with the Cloudflare bullshit and their attitude towards it. There are whole papers on the issues with it. When will this fucking nightmare end? I need suggestions. What things do other people use for this stuff? ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456866393573493))
- Hi pixelfed! You just added a mandatory Cloudflare ajax service to pixelfed.social? The page is empty now... ([antonlopez](https://mastodon.social/@antonlopez/102451687366539901))
- Ich nutz hauptsächlich Tor. Zwar heuchelt Cloudflare Tor-Freundlich zu sein, z.B. mit eigener Onion Adresse. Aber standardmäßig blocken die Tor Verbindungen, sofern man sie nicht freigibt.)
- Zudem empfinde ich es nicht gerade als Datenschutzfreundlich, die Cloudflare Proxy Server zu nutzen. Vor allem, da Cloudflare dem Patriot Act untersteht. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102440347862158580))
- außerdem empfinde ich persönlich es als Wohltuend, wenn die CloudFlare Fanboys mal genauso auf ein Forbidden stoßen, wie TOR User all zu gern bei CloudFlare ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102447153687932571))
- I think that I will stop using it, until they remove it from Cloudflare. I don't see it as something that is made for privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare for their main instance. ([Robin](https://welovela.in/objects/456f3bba-ee24-48c5-92a3-7f80349dfbc3))
- angesprochen sollten auch nur jene werden, die keine Ahnung haben, aber dann so tun, als hätten sie sie. IT Blogger, die Anleitungen dazu bringen, wie man die Tor Exit Knoten Liste herunter lädt um die IP Adressen dann zu blockieren. Weil CloudFlare ja gesagt hat.)
- Und jene, die keine Ahnung haben ... denen ist die Meinung der wirklichen Experten scheiß egal. Die lauschen lieber auf jene, die mit ihrem gefährlichen Halbwissen das Internet verpesten. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102445550843368442))
- Hyperbola members who don't care about Cloudflare, which disrepect the privacy over violation of rule 3 of the social contract ([HarvettFox96](https://hostux.social/@HarvettFox96/102414243375270600))
- Remember how the liars at cloudflare pretended that had come under attack (causing major downtime), only later to admit that they broke their own service because they're technically incompetent. Avoid them. ([schestowitz](https://pleroma.site/objects/a5533839-4678-4c06-975f-5ceceeaa793d))
- is this instance using Cloudflare somehow? Was getting errors from it when trying to access Mstdn yesterday. ([orbifx](https://mstdn.io/@orbifx/102399186438337881))
- They use cloudflare for their Matrix.org and other servers they operate. ([eo](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@eo/102396215079147841))
- They talk about decentralization, while being behind cloudflare. awesome ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102387933088472002))
- It's been estimated that today's Cloudflare outage is effecting about 10% of all websites world-wide. If a lot of your online world is down right now, your word and research topic for the day is decentralization ([raye](https://sunbeam.city/@raye/102372447641525998))
- Seems like the world's biggest MiTM is down and took a rather large number of websites with it ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102372539142565301))
- So I guess Liberapay is behind TheGreatCloudwall now ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102207994379806531))
- I want to thank Cloudflare for removing themselves from the internet. ([Chuculate](https://niu.moe/@Chuculate/102378374675476776))
- Yesterday it was cloudflare today it's facebook static content (images etc) don't load, seems like CDN problems too. Welcome to the centralized Internet... ([kravietz](https://social.privacytools.io/@kravietz/102378733712987218))
- Qué es Cloudflare, cómo funciona y por qué cuando se cae parte de internet se viene abajo ([GeekTale](https://mastodon.social/@GeekTale/102376704390517130))
- Вчера упал CloudFlare, из-за чего нарушилась работа крупнейших сервисов Интернета. Разработчики уже выпустили пост-мортем, из которого следует, что причиной падения стало – внимание – регулярное выражение, вызвавшее 100% нагрузку на CPU и, вследствие чего, множество 502-х ошибок в ответ на запросы. ([Groosha](https://mastodon.social/@Groosha/102376274244244420))
- Why you shouldn’t use services like Cloudflare to enable „high availability“  ([f2k1de](https://chaos.social/@f2k1de/102375564327003058))
- LMAO cloudflare is down AGAIN? ([DashEquals](https://ap.torlipen.net/objects/4236a828-7ba9-4c2c-9c40-c217c1f1d4e3))
- Natürlich bezahlst du nichts, dafür aber deine Besucher, die all ihre Daten und Metadaten einem in den USA durch den PatriotAct verpflichteten Dienst in den Rachen werfen. Noch dazu ein Dienst, der auf den meisten Seiten Tor blockiert. Fehler hin oder her ... Wer Datenschutz ernst nimmt, verzichtet auf Cloudflare und ähnliche Dienste. Und wer doch einen Proxy vor seinem eigentlichen Dienst brauch, kann ihn ja selbst aufsetzen. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102372968538354130))

- I don't use Cloudflare. ([veer66](https://mstdn.io/@veer66/102372440964130575))

- they are too powerful, too big already. we dont' need to use them for time. ([jeffcliff](https://niu.moe/@jeffcliff/102310896326359164))
- cloudflare is proprietarysoftware. To matter matters even worse, it's centralised and attached to a political system which subjugates 100+ governments. ([schestowitz](https://pleroma.site/objects/ec8ac84d-60c2-4001-900a-85938c18abda))

- Ich wollte mal wieder bei LiberaPay vorbeischauen, dann springt mir cloudflare entgegen. PayPal, Stripe und nun Cloudflare. Ein einst vielversprechendes Projekt schafft sich selbst ab. ([kuketzblog](https://social.tchncs.de/@kuketzblog/102228512812286306))
- It makes it really hard for us Tor-users to use liberapay actually. We do know about Under Attack mode already, and I would like you to reconsider and not use cloudflare :) ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102208159022447946))
- What the fuck lowtechmagazine, you pull your fancy schmancy oh were all low-bandwith and solar powered, but then you're behind FUCKING Cloudflare, banning ips (not even a captcha). Where's the low tech solarpunk shit huh, liberal hippie garbage ([f0x](https://social.pixie.town/@f0x/102204802211287233))
- I'm pretty sure just throwing up your statically generated site on a random provider would be more energy efficient because it doesn't have to go through Cloudflare's surveillance apparatus. ([f0x](https://social.pixie.town/@f0x/102204938741162533))
- No deja de llamar la atencion, que la inmensa mayoria de las instancias del fediverso usen cloudflare, el PEOR enemigo de la privacidad y el anonimato. ¿Sabian que cloudflare considera a Tor una importante fuente de ataques DDoS, cuando no existen estudios que lo demuestren? ([rtfm](https://ieji.de/@rtfm/102177593596150087))
