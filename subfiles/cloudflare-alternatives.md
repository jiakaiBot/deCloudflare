***Why you should say "No" to Cloudflare***


## Self-hosting
Self-hosting often works great, but it requires some effort to setup. It is 
more aimed at technical people.

We might create a guide for some self-hosting basics which don't require Cloudflare.
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) may be worth consideration if performance is the main concern.



## Alternatives
| Alternative       | Drawback                          | Price | Link |

## Not researched yet
### CDNJS
CDNJS is sponsored by Cloudflare. It might use it in the background.

## Why X is not included
| X       | Reason |
| ------- | ------ |
| Gitlab pages      | GitLab is now Cloudflared |
| Imperva | Uses Cloudflare. |
| jsDelivr | Uses Cloudflare, see their [network page](https://www.jsdelivr.com/network) |
| Netlify | Uses Amazon AWS which is also a content delivery network. It would be hypocritical to include it. |
| Siteground | Tor-hostile people. |

## History
Sucuri and eQualitie have a history of CloudFlare patronage, but no longer.
