***Why you should say "No" to Cloudflare***


## Self-hosting
Self-hosting often works great, but it requires some effort to setup. It is 
more aimed at technical people.

We might create a guide for some self-hosting basics which don't require 
Cloudflare.

`to consider: Is user---incapsula---origin really okay?`

## Alternatives
| Alternative       | Drawback                          | Price | Link |

| PerimeterX        | not gratis                        | ? | - |
| Impurva incapsula | not gratis                        | Paid | - |

### CDNJS
CDNJS is sponsored by Cloudflare. It might use it in the background.

## Why X is not included
| X       | Reason |
| ------- | ------ |
| Netlify | Uses Amazon AWS which is also a content delivery network. It would be hypocritical to include it. |
| Siteground | Tor-hostile people. |
|jsDelivr | Uses Cloudflare, see their [network page](https://www.jsdelivr.com/network) |
