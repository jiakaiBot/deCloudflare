```
Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news.
It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.
However, the term does not have a fixed definition, and has been applied more broadly to include any type of false information, 
including unintentional and unconscious mechanisms, and also by high-profile individuals to apply to any news unfavourable 
to their personal perspectives.
