## How many % of public Matrix services are using Cloudflare?


- [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(protocol))
```
Matrix is an open standard and communication protocol for real-time communication. 
It aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, 
in the way that standard Simple Mail Transfer Protocol email currently does for store-and-forward email service, 
by allowing users with accounts at one communications service provider to communicate with users of a different 
service provider via online chat, voice over IP, and videotelephony.
