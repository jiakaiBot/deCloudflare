## How many % of top 1 million most popular domains are using Cloudflare?


- [Tranco](https://github.com/DistriNet/tranco-list/)
```
Researchers in web security or Internet measurements often use rankings of popular websites. However, in our paper we showed that these rankings disagree on which domains are most popular, can change significantly on a daily basis and can be manipulated (by malicious actors).

As the research community still benefits from regularly updated lists of popular domains, we provide Tranco, a new ranking that improves upon the shortcomings of current lists. We also emphasize the reproducibility of these rankings and the studies using them by providing permanent citable references.

Here's the result.
