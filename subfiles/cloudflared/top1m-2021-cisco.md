- [Cisco Umbrella Popularity List](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/umbrella-static/index.html)
```
The popularity list contains our most queried domains based on passive DNS usage across our Umbrella global network of more than 100 Billion requests per day with 65 million unique active users, in more than 165 countries. Unlike Alexa, the metric is not based on only browser based 'http' requests from users but rather takes in to account the number of unique client IPs invoking this domain relative to the sum of all requests to all domains. In other words, our popularity ranking reflects the domain’s relative internet activity agnostic to the invocation protocols and applications where as ’site ranking’ models (such as Alexa) focus on the web activity over port 80 mainly from browsers.
