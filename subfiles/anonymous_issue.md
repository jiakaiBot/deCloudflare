## How to create an issue anonymously

If you want to create an issue but do not want to create an account you can send it from Mastodon.

- Note that created issue will be credited to _Anonymous_ and not you personally.
- Only the message part will be posted.


1. Create or Login to any Mastodon account.

2. Just send a message to [this deCloudflare account](https://mamot.fr/@deCloudflare).

Example:
```
Hello @deCloudflare how are you? blah blah...
```

3. Wait until you get a _favourite_ from deCloudflare.

4. (Optional) You can now delete your toot or account.
