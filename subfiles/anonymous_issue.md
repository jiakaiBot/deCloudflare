## How to create an issue anonymously


If you want to create an issue but do not want to create an account you can send it from [Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)).


- Note that created issue will be credited to _Anonymous_ and not you personally.
  - You cannot claim your credit later because you are unlinkable _Anonymous_.
- Only the message part will be posted.
  - Try not to mention other people inside your toot.
- Issue will be created with `comment` tag and `closed` state.


1. Create or Login to any Mastodon account.

2. Just send a public/private/direct message to this [@deCloudflare](https://mamot.fr/@deCloudflare) account.


Example:
```
Hello @deCloudflare how are you?
blah blah...
```

Warning: Spam, attack, unrelated-to-this-project messages will be silently ignored.


3. Wait until you get a _favourite_ from deCloudflare. This might take several hours.

4. (Optional) You can now delete your toot or account.
