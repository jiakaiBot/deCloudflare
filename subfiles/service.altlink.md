  - If you're locking your account, please accept AL's follow request otherwise AL can't read your toots.
  - If you're marking your account as `Bot`, AL will reject your request and send you a message.
    - Try to follow again within 24 hours. (opt-in by human)

3. When you post Cloudflared link, AL will send `direct` message to you with information.
  - `Boosts` will be ignored.
  - Direct messages older than 7 days will be deleted.
    - There is no good reason to keep old toots online.

> Settings

You can configure AL via `direct message`.

- 1: Do not message me same domain again for a day.
  - Default is `off`.
  - By default AL will notify you each time when you post _cf-example.com_. Turning this settings _on_ will silence second post for 24 hours.
- 2: Message me onionsite if available.
  - Default is `off`.
  - If you turn _on_ this settings AL will notify you with onionsite link. Note that AL will also notify you for non-cloudflare sites when onion is available.
- 3: Count my links and send me monthly report.
  - Default is `off`.
  - If you turn _on_ this settings AL will simply count how many links you shared publicly. Note that this might have duplicates. (because we DO NOT save what you shared)
- 4: Set my preferred language to "??". 
  - Default is `unset`.
  - If you tell AL your language, AL will try to use your language.
  - Available Languages are below.
    - de el en eo es fr hi ja kk ko ky ru zh
- 5: Show my current preferences.
  - No settings option.


```
set N V
```

- N is above numbers.
- V is value.
  - for number 1 to 3:
    - _one of_: y n yes no true false 1 0 on off
  - for number 4:
    - _one of_: available languages (see above)
  - for number 5:
    - none (see below example)
- You can mix uppercase if you want.
  - `sEt 1 TRuE` is same as `set 1 true`
