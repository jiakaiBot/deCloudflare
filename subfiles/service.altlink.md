### A little history

Once upon a time there was a bot named "_[CloudflareLink](https://social.privacytools.io/@cloudflarelink/with_replies)_" which was created by Anonymous.
It replied to many users who shared CF links publicly.

Not many people reacted it positively. Here is some of them.

- [kemonine@social.holdmybeer.solutions](https://social.holdmybeer.solutions/objects/9479c5be-40df-4ecd-a3fe-0209a9020dfd)
```
To the owner of this bot
You should be ashamed.
Quit drive by bro'ing our statuses.
Please fornicate with a pointy stick.
```

- [Sylvhem@eldritch.cafe](https://eldritch.cafe/@Sylvhem/102701484501099424)
```
Pointing to a copy rather than the original document if it's still online is bad practice too. Also, you are a very annoying bot.
```

They got annoyed and Mastodon server owner was pressured by their "spam" reports.

One of Mastodon server owner once [said](../tool/mastodonwch#some-public-reaction), "_your little protest bot is making people upset, and i'm worried it might cause people to defederate from the instance, please tone it down_."

For the record "_CloudflareLink_" was moved to other Mastodon servers 3 times and banned 2 times by 2 Mastodon services until the Anonymous decided to given up for good.

The main difference of AltLink is `opt-in`.
Those people who [share Cloudflare links casually](cloudflared/shared_mastodon.md) never receive notification until they have a good heart and follow AL.

  - If you've changed your mind and want to subscribe(opt-in) again, `unblock`, `unfollow` AL and `follow` again.


### "_Is it really CloudFlare!?_" check

Just send `domain name` or `URL` as `direct message` and AL will answer within 1 minute.

Here's an example.

```
@mitigator blog.emsisoft.com
```

You can also query multiple at once / mix domain and URLs

```
@mitigator
en.wikipedia.org
https://blog.emsisoft.com/wow/
www.wikimedia.org
```


### CloudFlareTest it!

You can call AltLink into your **public** **discussion** to test `above user's URL`. 
All you have to do is hit `Reply` button and 
- Include user `altlink`
- Add the word `cloudflaretest` (case does not matter)
- Send it as **non-direct** toot

AL will answer within 1 minute.

- This is a simple `Yes`/`No` test.
  - If you need _detailed_ check use above one instead.


Here's an example.

```
Hey @mad_dog, your blog need to do cloudflareTest. @mitigator
```


### Report a problem / Create an Issue

You can create an Issue without git account. Just send a **direct** message.
And don't worry,

- Multiple mentions (e.g. `@randomUser @altlink @otherUser blah blah blah`)
- _Public_ message (e.g. `there's a bot called @altlink`)

...will be ignored to prevent spam.
Your username part (before `@`) will be masked to protect your privacy.


### Settings

You can configure mitigator from [this website](https://mitigator.crimeflare.eu.org/).
