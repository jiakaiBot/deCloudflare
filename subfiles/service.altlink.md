### A little history

Once upon a time there was a bot named "_[CloudflareLink](https://social.privacytools.io/@cloudflarelink/with_replies)_" which was created by Anonymous.
It replied to many users who shared CF links publicly.

Not many people reacted it positively. Here is some of them.

- kemonine@social.holdmybeer.solutions
```
To the owner of this bot
You should be ashamed.
Quit drive by bro'ing our statuses.
Please fornicate with a pointy stick.
```

- Sylvhem@eldritch.cafe
```
Pointing to a copy rather than the original document if it's still online is bad practice too. Also, you are a very annoying bot.
```

They got annoyed and Mastodon server owner was pressured by their "spam" reports.

One of Mastodon server owner once [said](../tool/mastodonwch#some-public-reaction), "_your little protest bot is making people upset, and i'm worried it might cause people to defederate from the instance, please tone it down_."

For the record "_CloudflareLink_" was moved to other Mastodon servers 3 times and banned 2 times by 2 Mastodon services until the Anonymous decided to given up for good.

The main difference of AltLink is `opt-in`.
Those people who [share Cloudflare links casually](cloudflared/shared_mastodon.md) never receive notification until they have a good heart and follow AL.


### How to Subscribe

1. Follow [MitiGator](https://mastodon.pirateparty.be/@MitiGator).
  - Some instances such as [mastodon.social](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/16480) are blocking Altlink.

2. Send `any text` as **direct** message to MitiGator.
  - And MitiGator will follow back you _instantly_ with intro message.
    - If you're locking your account, please accept AL's follow request otherwise AL can't read your toots.
  - If you didn't got any reply make sure you are following MG.

3. When you share Cloudflared link, AL will send `direct` message to you with information.
  - Non-public messages older than *1* day will be deleted.
    - There is no good reason to keep old toots online.
      - [Should I Delete My Tweets?](https://www.wired.com/story/the-know-it-alls-should-i-delete-my-tweets/)


### How to Unsubscribe

1. Just `unfollow` AL's account **on your side**.
  - **AL should unfollow you within an hour**.
    - AL do not attempt to re-follow you.
  - If you've changed your mind and want to subscribe(opt-in) again simply `follow` again.


### Suggest clean alternatives

Just ask (send **direct** message to) Mitigator and he will provide some suggestions.

- This is related to Settings' `Suggest other non-Cloudflare alternative sites when available`.
  - If there is a network problem _or_ there is no alternative MG will not reply anything.


Syntax: `@MitiGator ?URL` or `ÔºüURL`

Put Cloudflared URL like this...

```
@mitigator ?https://cflove.myblog.site/cloud_is_internet/?blog=true
```

```
@mitigator

Ôºühttps://invite.party/cloudflare_users_only/
```


**1** question per toot. Below does **not** work.

```
@mitigator
?https://matthew.prince/blog/
?https://matthewprince.site/
?https://matthew.prince.name/
```


### Report a problem / Create an Issue

(To use this you need to enable last option)
You can create an Issue without git account. Just send a **direct** message.
And don't worry,

- Multiple mentions (e.g. `@randomUser @mitigator @otherUser blah blah blah`)
- _Public_ message (e.g. `there's a bot called @mitigator`)

...will be ignored to prevent spam.
Your username part (before `@`) will be masked to protect your privacy.


### Settings

You can configure mitigator from [this website](https://mitigator.crimeflare.eu.org/).

For your poster/meme needs.

MitiGator's profile image shows an orange shield and a cartoon of the mascot character, ùôàùôûùô©ùôûùôÇùôñùô©ùô§ùôß, who stands proud as the MITM Prevention Alligator.
The mascot wears a referee top and red sash across chest. Above the shield is 'MitiGator' in arching, bold, small caps, serif lettering.
