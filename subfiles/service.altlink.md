### A little history

Once upon a time there was a bot named "_[CloudflareLink](https://social.privacytools.io/@cloudflarelink/with_replies)_" which was created by Anonymous.
It replied to many users who shared CF links publicly.

Not many people reacted it positively. Here is some of them.

- kemonine@social.holdmybeer.solutions
```
To the owner of this bot
You should be ashamed.
Quit drive by bro'ing our statuses.
Please fornicate with a pointy stick.
```

- Sylvhem@eldritch.cafe
```
Pointing to a copy rather than the original document if it's still online is bad practice too. Also, you are a very annoying bot.
```

They got annoyed and Mastodon server owner was pressured by their "spam" reports.

One of Mastodon server owner once [said](../tool/mastodonwch#some-public-reaction), "_your little protest bot is making people upset, and i'm worried it might cause people to defederate from the instance, please tone it down_."

For the record "_CloudflareLink_" was moved to other Mastodon servers 3 times and banned 2 times by 2 Mastodon services until the Anonymous decided to given up for good.

The main difference of AltLink is `opt-in`.
Those people who [share Cloudflare links casually](cloudflared/shared_mastodon.md) never receive notification until they have a good heart and follow AL.



### How to Subscribe

  - If you're locking your account, please accept AL's follow request otherwise AL can't read your toots.
    - If you **do not accept follower request within 15 hours**, your follower status will be resetted.
  - **If** there is a network instability and AL failed to follow back you **after 1 hour**:
    - Please `unfollow`, `wait 1 hour`, and `follow` again.

  - Non-public messages older than *1* day will be deleted.
    - There is no good reason to keep old toots online.

### "_Is it really CloudFlare!?_" check

Just send `domain name` or `URL` as `direct message` and AL will answer within 1 minute.

Here's an example.

```
@mitigator blog.emsisoft.com
```

You can also query multiple at once / mix domain and URLs

```
@mitigator
en.wikipedia.org
https://blog.emsisoft.com/wow/
www.wikimedia.org
```


### CloudFlareTest it!

**WARNING: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED IN THE FUTURE. USE BELOW OPTION INSTEAD.**

<s>You can call AltLink into your **public** **discussion** to test `above user's URL`. 
All you have to do is hit `Reply` button and 
- Mention user `@mitigator`
- Add the word `cloudflaretest` (case does not matter)
- Send it as **non-direct** toot

AL will answer within 1 minute.

- This is a simple `Yes`/`No` test.
  - If you need _detailed_ check use above one instead.


Here's an example.

```
Check my new blog! https://oh.my.god/
```
you reply:
```
Hey @mad_dog, your blog need to do cloudflareTest. @mitigator</s>
```


### Suggest clean alternatives

Just ask (send **direct** message to) Mitigator and he will provide some suggestions.

- This is related to Settings' `Suggest other non-Cloudflare alternative sites when available`.


Syntax: `@MitiGator ?URL` or `？URL`

Put Cloudflared URL like this...

```
@mitigator ?https://cflove.myblog.site/cloud_is_internet/?blog=true
```

```
@mitigator

？https://invite.party/cloudflare_users_only/
```


**1** question per toot. Below does **not** work.

```
@mitigator
?https://matthew.prince/blog/
?https://matthewprince.site/
?https://matthew.prince.name/
```


### Report a problem / Create an Issue

(To use this you need to enable `Circle` option)
You can create an Issue without git account. Just send a **direct** message.
And don't worry,

- Multiple mentions (e.g. `@randomUser @mitigator @otherUser blah blah blah`)
- _Public_ message (e.g. `there's a bot called @mitigator`)

...will be ignored to prevent spam.
Your username part (before `@`) will be masked to protect your privacy.


### Settings

You can configure mitigator from [this website](https://mitigator.crimeflare.eu.org/).
There are 2 ways:
- Open above website and follow the steps.
- _Or_ Send _one of_ below keyword as `direct` message to mitigator.
  - `cfg`  `conf`  `config`  `set`  `settings`
    - e.g. `@mitigator Settings`  `@mitigator cfg`


### Download PNG Logo

For your poster/meme needs.

MitiGator's profile image shows an orange shield and a cartoon of the mascot character, 𝙈𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙂𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧, who stands proud as the MITM Prevention Alligator.
The mascot wears a referee top and red sash across chest. Above the shield is 'MitiGator' in arching, bold, small caps, serif lettering.
