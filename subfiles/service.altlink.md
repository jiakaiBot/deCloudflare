![](../image/altlink_sample.jpg)


This is `opt-in` service.


> Subscribe

1. Follow [Alternative Link (AL)](https://mamot.fr/@altlink).
  - Some trigger-happy instances such as `mastodon.social` are blocking altlink.

2. AL will accept your follow request and follow back you.
  - If you're locking your account, please accept AL's follow request otherwise AL can't read your toots.
  - If you're marking your account as `Bot`, AL will reject your request and send you a message.
    - Try to follow again within 24 hours. (opt-in by human)

3. When you post Cloudflared link, AL will send `direct` message to you with information.
  - `Boosts` will be ignored.
  - Direct messages older than 3 days will be deleted.
    - There is no good reason to keep old toots online.


> Unsubscribe

1. Just `block` or `mute` AL's account on your side.
  - AL do not attempt to re-follow you.
  - If you've changed your mind and want to subscribe(opt-in) again, `unblock`, `unfollow` AL and `follow` again.


> Settings

You can configure AL via `direct message`.

- 1: Do not message me same domain again for a day.
  - Default is `off`.
  - By default AL will notify you each time when you post _cf-example.com_. Turning this settings _on_ will silence second post for 24 hours.
- 2: Message me onionsite if available.
  - Default is `off`.
  - If you turn _on_ this settings AL will notify you with onionsite link. Note that AL will also notify you for non-cloudflare sites when onion is available.
- 3: Count my links and send me report monthly.
  - Default is `off`.
  - If you turn _on_ this settings AL will simply count how many links you shared publicly. Note that this count will have duplicates because we never save what you shared.
  - If you change this settings counter will reset to 0.
- 4: Set my preferred language to "??". 
  - Default is unset.
    - AL will use language based on your toot.
  - If you tell AL your language, AL will speak your language.
- 5: Show my current preferences.
  - No settings option.
