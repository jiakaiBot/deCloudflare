### A little history

Once upon a time there was a bot named "_[CloudflareLink](https://social.privacytools.io/@cloudflarelink/with_replies)_" which was created by Anonymous.
It replied to many users who shared CF links publicly.

Not many people reacted it positively. Here is some of them.

- kemonine@social.holdmybeer.solutions
```
To the owner of this bot
You should be ashamed.
Quit drive by bro'ing our statuses.
Please fornicate with a pointy stick.
```

- Sylvhem@eldritch.cafe
```
Pointing to a copy rather than the original document if it's still online is bad practice too. Also, you are a very annoying bot.
```

They got annoyed and Mastodon server owner was pressured by their "spam" reports.

One of Mastodon server owner once [said](../../tool/mastodonwch#some-public-reaction), "_your little protest bot is making people upset, and i'm worried it might cause people to defederate from the instance, please tone it down_."

For the record "_CloudflareLink_" was moved to other Mastodon servers 3 times and banned 2 times by 2 Mastodon services until the Anonymous decided to given up for good.

The main difference of AltLink is `opt-in`.
Those people who [share Cloudflare links casually](../cloudflared/shared_mastodon.md) never receive notification until they have a good heart and follow AL.


### How to Subscribe

1. **Follow** the [AltLink Account](https://101010.pl/@mg). (if you [do not have Mastodon account](https://101010.pl/invite/txvFuk9h))
  - Some instances such as [mastodon.social](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/16480) are blocking Altlink.

2. Send _any text_ as **direct** ("Mentioned people only") message to above account.
  - e.g. `@mg follow`
  - And it will follow back you _instantly_ with introduction message.
    - If you're locking your account, please accept it's follow request otherwise it can't read your toots.
  - If you didn't got any reply make sure you are following it.

### How to Unsubscribe

  - **it should unfollow you within an hour**.
    - it do not attempt to re-follow you.
  - If you've changed your mind and want to subscribe(opt-in) again simply `follow` again.

### Report a problem / Create an Issue

- By default any direct message WILL NOT forwarded to issues for spam protection.
  - You can enable this option by going to `Settings website` and turn on `Talk` option.

You can create an Issue without git account. Just send a **direct** message.
And don't worry

- Multiple mentions (e.g. `@randomUser @mg @otherUser blah blah blah`)
- _Public_ message (e.g. `there's a bot called @mg`)

will be ignored to prevent spam.
Your username part (before `@`) will be masked to protect your privacy.


### Settings
