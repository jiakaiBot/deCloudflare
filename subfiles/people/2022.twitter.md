- From the second post, judging by the cloudflare error, it's more than likely a regional thing. ([Tanookicatoon](https://twitter.com/Tanookicatoon/status/1518685663117389824))
- It's not blocking. It's a system crash. The other gives me pause as well but the Access Denied is from Cloudflare (not enoughserver space for the unexpected deluge of new activity), not CoSo. ([Tsiser45](https://twitter.com/Tsiser45/status/1518690734962053121))
- The bugs seem to have eased. Cloudflare is no longer blocking access from my phone. ([FieldMontgomery](https://twitter.com/FieldMontgomery/status/1518708796360646661))
- Did you get a "Cloudflare Error 1020, Access denied instantly" warning? Because that's what I'm getting and I can't seem to figure out why. ([feministpinko](https://twitter.com/feministpinko/status/1518646726168506368))
- It's some sort of cloudflare error, per a giggling. Not that I really know what that means. ([Jillbles](https://twitter.com/Jillbles/status/1518645607417720834))
- devops, there's nothing like being in SSL hell for a while, epsically when you have a MITM attacker/service, that you have paid for cloudflare ... ([toxicnaan](https://twitter.com/toxicnaan/status/1518648779209117704))
- Yeah, I am getting a cloudflare error right now. ([gods_man](https://twitter.com/gods_man/status/1518645553697017857))
- Weirdly, I‚Äôm getting a CloudFlare error when I try to sign up. Can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm blocked or if they‚Äôre being hammered by traffic. ([StevenSokulski](https://twitter.com/StevenSokulski/status/1518639870154928128))
- Heads up, everyone! is down, so I won't be posting anything until the Cloudflare error is fixed. & - heads up to you too. ([AustinBMedia_](https://twitter.com/AustinBMedia_/status/1518659531605266434))

- Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 says: "We will never log your IP address (the way other companies identify you). And we‚Äôre not just saying that. We‚Äôve retained a big 4 accounting firm to audit our assertions about our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say."

- Hey Cloudflare I'd still like to talk to you about why you allow doxxing sites :) I mean, you think you're such a great internet resource, but if you're just protecting bullies and doxxers, you're complete garbage, i hope you get 'deleted' soon. ([Fallout76_Clown](https://twitter.com/Fallout76_Clown/status/1518092394939494401))
- Thanks cloudflare to speed up and secure my blog. Even educational websites are under attack and besieged these days. :-/ the bad guys with Cloudflare: 306 malicious requests blocked or challenged in the last month cloudflare ([ec_pedagogy](https://twitter.com/ec_pedagogy/status/1518101792004976643))
- One of the more annoying things is that the medium RSS feeds are rate limited behind a Cloudflare captcha, which basically makes it useless :( ([georgeomnet](https://twitter.com/georgeomnet/status/1518026518101901312))
- Cloudflare has helped me save 114 GB in the last month. cloudflare ([UvinduBro](https://twitter.com/UvinduBro/status/1517900951373611009))
- To only allow access to your resource THROUGH CloudFlare Access People could still access it if they went direct to the public IP... blocking ALL except the CloudFlare IP's will stop people accessing via direct IP ([auth_dot_log](https://twitter.com/auth_dot_log/status/1517865689998143493))
- Cloudflare Hi. Two of Cloudflare IP addresses are blocked in Russia: 188.114.96.2 and 188.114.97.2. And my website is blocked too. How can I fix this? ([themarfa](https://twitter.com/themarfa/status/1517820136257949696))
- is blocked by GFW, so you cannot access it in China. If you want to access it with a proxy, proxy'll not work, since proxy is blocked by Opensea and the fucking Cloudflare. That's why I use . ([ntoooop](https://twitter.com/ntoooop/status/1517763246354169856))
- now deep dive into / cloudflare wtf is that nazi crap One .com? over to joker .com from 1994 no less.. down to ' nidder? or nitter? crazy thing.. some clone of twitter.. where some' accts still exist odd" . careful artists.. no bueno w. crypto piracy up the wazoo wow ([GladesYouth](https://twitter.com/GladesYouth/status/1517652356237770752))
- Built a campaign site engine for Sneakersnstuff back in 2017. When they used it for limited sneaker releases the load went from 0 to 2M within the first minute.. üòÖ And that was after multiple gates like CAPTCHA, mandatory credit card input, Cloudflare's DDOS protection etc. ([peralmq](https://twitter.com/peralmq/status/1517540276855836672))
- that specific error is coming from the cloudflare api! when developing/publishing, we upload a form that contains the whole worker definition - modules, bindings, all that. something about node 18 is ruining that formdata upload. ([threepointone](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1517542751549726720))
- 1) That was fascinating, thank you. 2) Sticking Cloudflare's free plan in front of the webserver to provide a caching layer is probably the easiest way to stop this happening again if you have a couple of hours to spare. ([shadowcat_mst](https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/1517593871273889801))
- Cloudflare es una empresa de seguridad, no puede atacar servidores, de hecho yo la uso para encriptar mis comunicaciones, es algo parecido a una vpn. Seguramente el servidor de esa web haya tenido un error cuando el webmaster ha actualizado la web, o ha sufrido un ataque ddos ([IbzClubbers](https://twitter.com/IbzClubbers/status/1517514850200657926))

- ini kabar manis 3 tahun lalu, tp kini telkomsel jg gunakan firewall utk blokir - bukan hanya dns. jadi solusinya pakai vpn, mnrt saya yg aman dan murah adlh cloudflare warp atau icloud private relay. ([Ariyadi](https://twitter.com/Ariyadi/status/1517413844737740802))
- Huge industry to try and stop it. Apple has whole teams dedicated to the problem and cloudflare has a team that‚Äôs trying to work on handling it at their layer. ([JFK_but_lamer](https://twitter.com/JFK_but_lamer/status/1517255714930102273))
- Cloudflare My site is under attack - Your security it's not working well - A paid plan is better ? infosec security cloud ([HackersOIHEC](https://twitter.com/HackersOIHEC/status/1517183000097828865))
- You can stop at any point in this list, but for maximal improvement: 1. Check the Automatic Signed Exchanges checkbox in Cloudflare. 2. Ensure HTML is cacheable and doesn't Vary by UA or Cookie. (We're removing these requirements soon.) ([twifkak](https://twitter.com/twifkak/status/1517223823875006464))
- real, their cloudflare service blocked my ip, easy to fix but makes one realize there is only one web-app, at least I only know one.. ([PSchlutermann](https://twitter.com/PSchlutermann/status/1517167628220993536))

- So when you report a phishing page to Cloudflare, you also are by default telling the website owner but is that also the cloudflare customer? ([DrWhax](https://twitter.com/DrWhax/status/1517141108244897793))
- I've been looking everywhere for some support with Cloudflared tunnels and I can't seem to find anything with my issue. Is there any chance I can get a hand with this? ([bloodshotpico](https://twitter.com/bloodshotpico/status/1517157288523354112))
- rata rata vpn yg koneksinya cepet (at least kalo mau streaming lancar) harus bayar sih. yg free ada limit speed nya. tergantung buat apa. klo cuma mau akses website yg diblokir, mending pake dns cloudflare, gratis, tinggal setup sendiri ([gulingkotak](https://twitter.com/gulingkotak/status/1517147011921096706))

- Hey Cloudflare Matthew, I know this will fall on deaf ears again since you have already blocked one grieving mom but do the right thing and stop hosting Sanctioned Suicide. Teenagers and young adults are being taught and influenced on how to take their lives every day. ([PBsMom19](https://twitter.com/PBsMom19/status/1517159936236605441))

- Vind dit een beetje hetzelfde als covidbeheersing: soms is politiek maken niet handig en zijn deskundigen hard nodig. Tiep dit trouwens vanaf een geheel LUKS-versleuteld Manjaro OS via betaalde VPN, https DNS via cloudflare dus breek me de muil niet open. Meer later op wepside.

- JP publishers only post a warning once or twice to remind you all, but they take the longer route. They already made someone get arrested for operating an illegal site üòÇ & - Kodansha, Kadokawa, Shogakukan, Sueisha are suing Cloudflare for allowing shroom sites to proliferate.

- I think Cloudflare communicates the page has been blocked, because of the region, although it doesn't provide an explanation as to why. ([GosoraProject](https://twitter.com/GosoraProject/status/1516543204799131648))
