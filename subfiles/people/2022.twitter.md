- Tor browser ( Sinon tu dois régler ton DNS à la main sur ton appareil (c’est assez facile. Tu peux prendre celui de Google ou celui de CloudFlare, ils ne bloquent rien.

- Is cloudflare 1.1.1.1 with warp protocol and encrypted dns garbage? Asking for a Russian friend who can access twitter cos these guys are doing a hella job fucking up the censorship.

- Definitely bullish on anti-botting contracts, but it's shockingly naive to think regular browser automation won't become cheaper/faster/easier in the future for botters. Even Cloudflare and Google haven't fully solved botting yet and serve those stupid traffic light captcha's. ([ShillTiger](https://twitter.com/ShillTiger/status/1522692926932983808))
- Hello, my friend has a domain through Cloudflare and accidentally deleted the cloudflare component and readded it.

- Of course! Looking into other security options for after I get the current database back under control. Thinking cloudflare may be the way to go. That's only $20/month, so not free, but reasonable if it can stop the dozens of new bot accounts (and their spam posts) every day.

- EC-VOPRF is pretty cool Cloudflare uses it with their Captcha service so when the user completes one captcha, they get 30 one-time-use zero-proof passes that are anonymous.

- Well at least we know we're not alone! I don't have pro, so I have no avenue to ask Cloudflare to fix it.

- I keep thinking that CloudFlare is some kind of a weird human subject experiment on Tor users, like how many can be tricked into enabling JS. ([hackerb0t](https://twitter.com/hackerb0t/status/1519142272499175424))
- Turns out that Cloudflare don’t support SPF records, or at least that’s the error I got. ([s3_gunzel](https://twitter.com/s3_gunzel/status/1519125263745163264))

- Yeah. Rapid growth takes a hot minute to manage. Wasn’t even sure it had to do with CoSo since the error was CloudFlare. Modern web is layers on layers ([devondevai](https://twitter.com/devondevai/status/1518994627604451330))

This morning I'm getting the infamous Cloudflare 1020 error that plagues me at work. Employment Opportunities coming? ([NerdyTomas](https://twitter.com/NerdyTomas/status/1518960942582669314))
- It's a cloudflare error, not sure what the firewall is blocking on my system. I can hardly imagine they are blocking individual IPs. ([joesabin](https://twitter.com/joesabin/status/1518967758570074114))

- From the second post, judging by the cloudflare error, it's more than likely a regional thing. ([Tanookicatoon](https://twitter.com/Tanookicatoon/status/1518685663117389824))
- It's not blocking. It's a system crash. The other gives me pause as well but the Access Denied is from Cloudflare (not enoughserver space for the unexpected deluge of new activity), not CoSo. ([Tsiser45](https://twitter.com/Tsiser45/status/1518690734962053121))
- The bugs seem to have eased. Cloudflare is no longer blocking access from my phone. ([FieldMontgomery](https://twitter.com/FieldMontgomery/status/1518708796360646661))
- Did you get a "Cloudflare Error 1020, Access denied instantly" warning? Because that's what I'm getting and I can't seem to figure out why. ([feministpinko](https://twitter.com/feministpinko/status/1518646726168506368))

- CloudFlareが提供している 1.1.1.1 を使うと DNSクエリーが暗号化されて DNSハイジャック攻撃から守られる他 WARP機能を使うと近くのデータセンターまでの通信が暗号化される（VPNとは違う）ので いいぞー ([KenjiTammas](https://twitter.com/KenjiTammas/status/1518405200788463616))

- Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 says: "We will never log your IP address (the way other companies identify you). And we’re not just saying that. We’ve retained a big 4 accounting firm to audit our assertions about our systems annually to ensure that we're doing what we say."

- Hey Cloudflare I'd still like to talk to you about why you allow doxxing sites :) I mean, you think you're such a great internet resource, but if you're just protecting bullies and doxxers, you're complete garbage, i hope you get 'deleted' soon. ([Fallout76_Clown](https://twitter.com/Fallout76_Clown/status/1518092394939494401))
- Thanks cloudflare to speed up and secure my blog. Even educational websites are under attack and besieged these days. :-/ the bad guys with Cloudflare: 306 malicious requests blocked or challenged in the last month cloudflare ([ec_pedagogy](https://twitter.com/ec_pedagogy/status/1518101792004976643))
- One of the more annoying things is that the medium RSS feeds are rate limited behind a Cloudflare captcha, which basically makes it useless :( ([georgeomnet](https://twitter.com/georgeomnet/status/1518026518101901312))
- Cloudflare has helped me save 114 GB in the last month. cloudflare ([UvinduBro](https://twitter.com/UvinduBro/status/1517900951373611009))
- To only allow access to your resource THROUGH CloudFlare Access People could still access it if they went direct to the public IP... blocking ALL except the CloudFlare IP's will stop people accessing via direct IP ([auth_dot_log](https://twitter.com/auth_dot_log/status/1517865689998143493))
- Cloudflare Hi. Two of Cloudflare IP addresses are blocked in Russia: 188.114.96.2 and 188.114.97.2. And my website is blocked too. How can I fix this? ([themarfa](https://twitter.com/themarfa/status/1517820136257949696))

- Built a campaign site engine for Sneakersnstuff back in 2017. When they used it for limited sneaker releases the load went from 0 to 2M within the first minute.. 😅 And that was after multiple gates like CAPTCHA, mandatory credit card input, Cloudflare's DDOS protection etc. ([peralmq](https://twitter.com/peralmq/status/1517540276855836672))
- that specific error is coming from the cloudflare api! when developing/publishing, we upload a form that contains the whole worker definition - modules, bindings, all that. something about node 18 is ruining that formdata upload. ([threepointone](https://twitter.com/threepointone/status/1517542751549726720))
- 1) That was fascinating, thank you. 2) Sticking Cloudflare's free plan in front of the webserver to provide a caching layer is probably the easiest way to stop this happening again if you have a couple of hours to spare. ([shadowcat_mst](https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/1517593871273889801))
- Cloudflare es una empresa de seguridad, no puede atacar servidores, de hecho yo la uso para encriptar mis comunicaciones, es algo parecido a una vpn.

- Huge industry to try and stop it. Apple has whole teams dedicated to the problem and cloudflare has a team that’s trying to work on handling it at their layer. ([JFK_but_lamer](https://twitter.com/JFK_but_lamer/status/1517255714930102273))

- You can stop at any point in this list, but for maximal improvement: 1. Check the Automatic Signed Exchanges checkbox in Cloudflare. 2. Ensure HTML is cacheable and doesn't Vary by UA or Cookie. (We're removing these requirements soon.) ([twifkak](https://twitter.com/twifkak/status/1517223823875006464))

- rata rata vpn yg koneksinya cepet (at least kalo mau streaming lancar) harus bayar sih. yg free ada limit speed nya. tergantung buat apa. klo cuma mau akses website yg diblokir, mending pake dns cloudflare, gratis, tinggal setup sendiri ([gulingkotak](https://twitter.com/gulingkotak/status/1517147011921096706))
