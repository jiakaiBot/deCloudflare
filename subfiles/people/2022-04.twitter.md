- There seems to be some kind of outage, I don't know if it's on my end or not: Bad gateway The web server reported a bad gateway error. Ray ID: 6fe8235b5ff515af Your IP address: 108.36.156.67 Error reference number: 502 Cloudflare Location: Newark ([rht341](https://twitter.com/rht341/status/1516503485705076736))
- 关于翻墙软件，建议选cloudflare 1.1.1.1加密软件，这个高速软件技术极其先进 极其私密安全高速，不要买什么看似宣传很接地气VPN了，有各方面的风险，进一步国际联网建议V2Ray机场 ([SolidWorks5432](https://twitter.com/SolidWorks5432/status/1516418424007757831))
- Anyone else having a problem with Cloudflare blocking access to dot com ? Anyone know of a way around such censorship? Thanks. ([LegerPhoenix](https://twitter.com/LegerPhoenix/status/1516583044274130951))
- I think Cloudflare communicates the page has been blocked, because of the region, although it doesn't provide an explanation as to why. ([GosoraProject](https://twitter.com/GosoraProject/status/1516543204799131648))
- sorry i don't know why i tweeted that, but the autism won't let me delete it now lmao (also, i should've said DOMAINS is using nameservers from months ago and i realized i just have to stop using cloudflare on it lol) ([kimmykyle](https://twitter.com/kimmykyle/status/1516466604028084230))
- also an error came up that I didn't screenshot, but it said your Cert wasn't compatible with cloudflare ([saccvan](https://twitter.com/saccvan/status/1516636530265231361))
- Hey Cloudflare what does it take to get you to honour unsubscribes from your newsletters? I've quit 3 times and even deleted my account. Stop spamming. ([wherefishsing](https://twitter.com/wherefishsing/status/1516571948603817984))
