- One thing that people tend to despise is that Cloudflare doxxed a child abuse whistle blower. That is, someone reported an offending CF site to CF, and CF then disclosed their identity to the site owner, who then published it so users of that site could retaliate. When Matthew Prince (the CEO) was confronted about it, he said the whistle blower "should have used a fake name". ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106501447385521089))
- Avoid Libera.chat's web chat folks-- it's a privacy abusing Cloudflare site with exclusive access restrictions (so it's a walledgarden). ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500771150474833))
- Wire has shortcomings for sure. XMPP is great for advanced users. Matrix caters for novices IIUC but Cloudflare has a role that screams run away. Element.io is a Cloudflare site. It's avoidable (thanks fdroid!) but it's a big red flag that the people behind it are not on the ball & so it should be approached w/great caution b/c incompetency can manifest in other ways. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106500007882984472))
- It's actually a netneutrality problem for MS & Google to block on the basis of IP address, because that policy creates access inequality. It's comparable to what Cloudflare is doing to Indians & Serbians, whereby they force users of cheap ISPs (which use CGNAT) to solve CAPTCHA. Those users must pay a fee to get the privs of IPv4 or IPv6. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106495857763772189))
- matrix uses Cloudflare for some of their web stuff so i've not looked further into it. I should mention that Jami can be used asynchronously, but it's not straight forward.. someone at one end has to run their own server for it to work. So indeed it's still impractical for novice-to-novice async comms. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106495402820022110))
- In this case, it's people in Serbia & India who buy the cheapest possible residential Internet connections from ISPs that use CGNAT & charge extra for IPv4 or IPv6. Cloudflare blocks them by default, & ReadTheDocs maintains those dicriminatory settings, which are the gatekeepers of Linux Mint docs. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106488846344894792))
- that petition is only reachable on a restricted access Cloudflare website. It's really not worth it to promote the kind of exclusive selective democracy that changeDotOrg pushes. It's anti-democratic. BTW NaturalNews, your website has the same problem. I can't see your article. Perhaps rightly so, I don't get the impression your articles good quality anyway. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106471400224908958))
- Libera.chat is using Microsoft to host their website and their web-irc gateway uses Cloudflare's exclusive corporate walled garden, configured to block Tor and push hCAPTCHA ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106461974011143181))
- A project with a privacy mission that tries to get people to use a Cloudflare service has an inherent integrity & trust problem. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106449419715706784))
- I wonder if Matthew James Seidel, who seems to oppose central & singular corporate access to data and power over it, as well as surveillanceCapitism, knows that his article is in Cloudflare's walled garden. Strypey: I suggest following ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106423892077310044))
- It's disturbing that the FrightfulFive excludes Cloudflare. It's easy to give up Apple & Google compared to CF. A boycott on CF would mean giving up the right to vote for Americans in 10% of the country. How many other tech giants stand in the way of something as basic and essential as voting in elections? ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106422851350267117))
- InternetArchive has been down most of the day now. For Tor users who refuse to connect to Cloudflare sites that means ~34% of the web is unreachable. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106416671893542340))
- At the very least, the free world is well outside of the jailed walled-garden of Cloudflare ("CF"). ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106415974049430218))
- Aparentemente, quem solicitar um pedido de agendamento para vacinação contra o COVID-19, terá de partilhar (uma vez mais) os seus dados pessoais com a Cloudflare. ([privacylx](https://social.privacytools.io/@PrivacyLX/106389113761332276))
- ist down und das hat Auswirkungen auf Deddit, GitHub, PayPal, Amazon & Co., So viel zum dezental'em Internet, die eigentlichen Schaltzentralen und Gatekeeper sind u.a. die CDN Netzwerke wie eben erwähnte fastly oder CloudFlare.Eng. ([kubikpixel](https://chaos.social/@kubikpixel/106374946000819862))
- There has to be a better way to solicit donations from those who don't want to be tracked or have their data exploited than to send donors to privacy abusing sites in the very same post. All of those options are privacy abusing except (perhaps) bunq.me. PayPal: shares data w/600+ companies; patreon, liberapay, opencollective: all tor-hostile Cloudflare sites; ko-fi: blocks Tor. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106369463181760974))
- That's a good thing. Tcl did self harm when they jailed all the docs in Cloudflare. Fuck that language. I use it, but I actually won't share my Tcl code publicly because the asshats made the docs exclusive. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106337561231889923))
- Why do us Cloudflare?Blatantly trying to rustle my jimmies. ([mxtthxw](https://mastodon.online/@mxtthxw/106336665604365037))
- Liberapay puts some quite untrustworthy entities in the loop who make it more privacy abusing than going direct from bank to bank. LP only gives you anonymity to the recipient (who is usually the only entity you trust with your PII). Cryptocurrency is a great option if you can work out how to actually get some of it privately without Cloudflare in the loop. ([aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/106325489106351883))
- indeed it's a hypocrisy for Matrix to use Cloudflare. It's the reason I don't use Matrix. Cloudflare has taken roughly ~30% of the web so far, and most of the world has no idea. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106290479632794650))
- I can not understand why FOSS decentralizing Projects hides behind cloudflare helping a centralizing service to get market shares. wanted to checkout pixelfed but impossible to visit the projects site. this does not give me a good feeling, so currently no listing for pixelfed at . ([kmj](https://mastodon.ctseuro.com/@kmj/106271305313956903))
- Liberals are generally fucked when it comes to banking b/c commercial banks finance fossil fuels & private prisons. Credit unions try to be an ethical alternative but then they outsource every micro-task possible (printing statements & billpay) to large centralized corporporations. Cloudflare is spreading like brush-fire compromising credit unions like crazy now. Privacy is dying. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106194996836780743))
- avoid LibreTranslate.com. It's a Cloudflare site. is a privacy-respecting instance that uses the LibreTranslate backend, so that's worth a look. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106179270923347485))
- A creditUnion was traditionally more ethical than banks, but there's a recent trend of credit unions putting their platform on Cloudflare, which makes it both evil and untrustworthy. And GABV isn't paying attention to it. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106177731238262439))
- honestly had forgotten why we rejected LBRY, that's why we are slowly developing a BLOCKMARKING system.Rather than going "Oh crap, its Cloudflare!" we are actively blockmarking now.The Cloudflared web is pervasive. By giving them content remember you are help people to stay on that service and therefore might be inadvertently helping cf to surveil those people (and yourself if you want to interact with those ppl. Why we produced fediFlyers ;)It's fully up to you, though. ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106125752340312118))
- What I like about the Vivaldi web browser is that it feels like the team is actually trying to make a better, for some value of that word, browser; not just Chrome with some shtick added/removed. I get useful stuff I want to have straight out of the box, not just another surveillance capitalism tour de force, Cloudflare dependency or cryptocurrency shrill. ([steinar](https://snabelen.no/@Steinar/106120498395822356))
- As Tor users become increasingly marginalized (proportional to the growth of Cloudflare), there is a tiny community within the Tor community who is even more acutely marginized: Tor users who are ethical enough to avoid Cloudflare sites rather than just using TorBrowser as a CAPTCHA circumvention. TorProject & EFF are on the wrong side of this as they look the other way. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106120592802255375))
- the most fun ive had with for is going through kf thread and everybody was is posting just archive.md links and not original links and that shitty site has cloudflare or something and it requires to complete google captcha Every Damn Time i wanna look at archive ([kk](https://pl.sadx.moe/objects/2923cadf-f62e-45f4-b810-e4db7f5e27e6))
- I am usure if it is a good style to operate element website which is a decentralized solution behind a very strong centralizing cloudflare service. The matrix site is free of this centralize hard stuff for the net. ([kmj](https://mastodon.ctseuro.com/@kmj/106115095366141235))
- How can we call regular companies not to use cloudflare or not to ban tor exit nodes if entities which claim that they are super privacy oriented use this word only because of its hype.Session - getsession.org - cloudflare.pinephone - they confirmed that privacy is only a nice byproduct(sic!). You cannot use tor to sign up in their forum. You cannot connect to their IRC using tor.We are just Don Quixotes. Saaaad.@session ([br0m3x](https://social.weho.st/@Br0m3x/106114249620091706))
- in this case the site you were trying to access should be avoided anyway. alternativeto.net is a Tor-blocking Cloudflare site. We need an alternative to alternativeto.net :) ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106110132925701737))
- What DNS provider do you use and why? I use DNS Watch by default as it's preset in Pihole and my modem. I was originally drawn to Cloudflare for its promises of privacy and no censorship, but I've since noticed all the bad press. I'm interested in OpenDNS and LibreDNS but it would be good to read some kind of in-depth comparison if one is available. networking homenetwork FOSS ([syntax](https://social.privacytools.io/@syntax/106104567019673305))
- Next website RSS unavailable for RSS-Reader: lolnein comics. Thanks cloudflare Why is there nobody at Cloudflare bringing the idea up that feeds should be less restrictive by default? ([lemming](https://chaos.social/@lemming/106101921586938623))
- chg dot org, moveon, & actionnetwork are all Tor-blocking Cloudflare sites. This is what Cloudflare impeding democracy looks like. It gives a "one more step" page and shows a broken CAPTCHA ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018779179419354))
- I don't sign petitions on Cloudflare sites. I can't even read it. But I might sign it if it were on a site like openpetition.org. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018735693132453))
- And Visa is even more reckless than Mastercard, as in exposes your card to CloudFlare, who can link that to ~30% of what CF sees in your web traffic (your identity under a microscope). So that's also a catch22. And the thing is, they aren't offering the opt-out b/c they want to. A law is forcing them to. The trap they're using likely puts them in violation of the law. ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/105986349939062443))
- So elementaryOS calls themselves "privacy-respecting" as the very 1st opening statement of their CloudFlare website. Hypocrisy indeed. ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/105984790472219324))
- Wenn man sich in Berlin gegen Corona / Covid impfen lassen will, muß man sich bei Doctolib anmelden. Anscheinend gehen alle Daten über Cloudflare USA und werden dann eventuell bei Amazon AWS gespeichert. Was ist mit dem Datenschutz? Kann man keine Impfung kriegen ohne persönliche Daten mit diesen Konzernen zu teilen?(@lfdi - in BaWü wird Doctolib offenbar für Testterminvergabe eingesetzt?) ([debacle](https://framapiaf.org/@debacle/105972511452684056))
- indeed the guy is really grasping at straws to try to run smear campaigns. Before reading anything, it was obvious that not only is privacyWatchdogIO using a CloudFlare DNS, they are proxying through CF with a config to block Tor users. The About page really makes it clear the guy is a jackass. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105962994557048605))
- I switched my main domain name over to njalla and I&apos;m happy to be on the path toward becoming cloudflare free. It&apos;s quite cost prohibitive though, so I&apos;m definitely rethinking the quantity of domains that I own. Probably for the best that I shimmy things down anyway. Three domain names will cost $60/year, which is crazy, but worth it to support a much needed project :) dns registrar domains ([kvvpa](https://mastodon.social/@kvvpa/106095066092843919))
- + for for rejecting green(washing) status of Cloudflare/Amazon hosted sites ([miklo](https://fosstodon.org/@miklo/106094987699078073))
- なんかCloudflareが不安定になったっぽいような挙動だった ([mohemohe](https://mstdn.plusminus.io/@mohemohe/106067124209819215))
- Ich habe jetzt mal Blokada 5 installiert (ohne Account) und in der Android Anzeige steht jetzt "Aktiv - Schutz: Mittel - Cloudflare".Was soll den das bedeuten und wie werde ich da Cloudflare wieder los? ([favstarmafia](https://social.anoxinon.de/@favstarmafia/106046678515340208))
- Vivimos en un mundo que dice fomentar la automatización, pero cuando los usuarios automatizamos parte de nuestra actividad en internet para recuperar parte de nuestra soberania digital nos meten el puto cloudflare ray. ([sergiotarxz](https://pleroma.aspie.freemyip.com/objects/cefaa30b-6842-40bf-a762-5990209b5d35))
- Wir sollten dabei auch die Nutzung des US amerikanischen MITM Proxy Cloudflare nicht vergessen. ;)Empfehlung des Hauses: ([purelinux](https://social.tchncs.de/@purelinux/106030293067296833))
- Because of stupid admins using Cloudflare I'm unable to use Minifluxx to read their RSS feed 🤬 ([lemming](https://chaos.social/@lemming/106093111435969969))
- You are not alone on that. When it happens to an anonymous user, legal recourse requires self-doxing, which is a shame. But non-anonymous victims of Cloudflare's blog spam should sue CF in small claims court, if they reside in a US state that has anti-spam laws. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106092842171085977))
- gets worse.Isn't ReclaimTheNetDotOrg a f$king Cloudflare site, also? ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106080932475511547))
- 45 office uses Cloudflare as well.For that matter NAS uses Cloudflare. ([mhjohnson](https://noagendasocial.com/@mhjohnson/106093164121290402))
- Mike Lindell is using CLOUDFLARE for his new "$10MM" FrankSpeech.comNow am I missing something here or is that crazy? ([commandlinekid](https://noagendasocial.com/@commandlinekid/106093139313455072))
- Very sad to learn that RIPE are now using Cloudflare. Yet another critical piece of infrastructure is under the control of a US company, and thus the US govt.I voiced my objection when I was asked for feedback and am told it is an emergency response to DDoS attacks, but they are considering keeping it in place. Cloudflare can now issue TLS certs on behalf of RIPE.Cloudflare can and do have outages, and the last one was ([dentangle](https://chaos.social/@dentangle/106029153024488971))
- Can someone give me an alternative to Cloudflare for DDoS protection? ([joerebelloharley](https://tilde.zone/@joerebelloharley/106018769569370126))
- If your website requires JavaScript or to fill out a CAPTCHA in order for me to view static text on an html page, you will not get my click-through. Also, fuck CloudFlare. All hail the waybackmachine! ([toiletpaper](https://shitposter.club/objects/3ff8caaf-0fe9-4f96-8d7b-bc253ffc1ea3))
- What’s this fuckery?So cloudflare takes it upon itself to censor websites now? (and of course it fucks it up)I can tell you with 100% certainty that these are not email addresses... 🤣🤣🤣 ([requiem](https://hackers.town/@requiem/106076888752929099))
- Hosted behind cloudflare... on AWS...we know how this will end.There is a playbook. ([thegibson](https://hackers.town/@thegibson/106065999743249062))
- I notice that both the UK labour and conservative parties are on cloudflare. This means that for example if you need to interact with those sites in order to become a member then that traffic will be intercepted and decrypted by a third party based in San Francisco, and very likely USG will have access to that. So for example this probably means that USG has a complete list of anyone who joined the Labour party during the Corbyn era. ([bob](https://epicyon.freedombone.net/@bob/106062964578845509))
- Looking up domain registration details for some organizations I know of, and being horrified that some of them are on cloudflare. In some cases that has non-trivial political implications. ([bob](https://epicyon.freedombone.net/@bob/106062927416983698))
- I didn’t exactly want to do it, but I needed to move OH.MG over to CloudFlare for some extra functionality I couldn’t recreate on my own. For the majority of the domain isn’t using the proxy, only 1 maybe 2 subdomains at most ([mmn](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@mmn/106037880862012606))
- Looks like Cloudflare nuked Disqus comments from their blog ([angristan](https://mstdn.io/@angristan/106020734058675983))
- Does change.org have Cloudflare? Didn’t know. Yeah, the problem with OpenPetiton is that I can’t reach as wide a mass of people than on Change. ([joerebelloharley](https://tilde.zone/@joerebelloharley/106018758584547570))
- just a heads up: LibreGit is a Cloudflare site. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106004641856311646))
- yikes- that EFF link redirects to a privacy-abusing Cloudflare site. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105997716676013916))
- Went into two restaurant+bars recently & was told "we have no paper menus due to COVID; use your phone to get the web menu". It's disturbing that a B&M business just assumes everyone has a smartphone & they're willing to marginalize those who do not. One of the bars outsourced to a site that outsourced to Cloudflare so the online menu discriminated further against Tor users. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106076523281386835))
- the company I'm working for decided to place the core products behinde cloudflare , the fight to avoid this was futile 😒 now, months after this, new security concerns are popping up...unfortunately not from our "IT Security Manager" but from us: this "security" guy is pushing hard to install company wide qualys and zscaler 🙈 I'm really sick of this 💩 Time to cut of with some wine in the weekend 🍷 and change thoughts! ([shinice](https://social.tchncs.de/@ShinIce/106075980593979334))
- IETF, the place where people turn to for open standards, RFC's, etc, has put itself in the exclusive walledGarden of Cloudflare. How utterly despicable. ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106075330874815410))
- thanks, now I can confirm that CloudFlare really doesn't like Python urllib. I get an annoying 403 error. ([alexis](https://mas.to/@alexis/106073418808617107))
- Did you know, Cloudflare monopolises Fediverse dating instances.I'm sure they say it is to "protect" them. While also collecting lots of data that they can use later, you know, when the person finally learns things and wants to get into politics.winkpsyop mastodon bigData useTor useI2P ([dsfgs](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/106042400816418867))

- So I’m still slowly undoing my connections to big data. One I’ve grown accustomed to but need to change is Cloudflare. Any suggestions out there in the fediverse for managing domains and DNS settings? ([kvvpa](https://mastodon.social/@kvvpa/106020579499063416))
- Tor users who visit ACM via WaybackMachine get put in an endless direction loop when visiting to avoid Cloudflare ([koherecowatchdog](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/106019323025090237))
- Cloudflare attacks Tor users, and that attack is ultimately an attack on privacy. But non-Tor users have it worse in a way, because they don't know when Cloudflare is seeing their traffic. They see the HTTPS padlock & think they have a safe connection, when actually Cloudflare sees their usernames, passwords, bank details, everything that goes to the Cloudflared website. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/106018962714167159))
- If you have to use Cloudflare for some reason, you can still allow Tor users to bypass the annoying challenge that usually comes up.Check "Firewall" - "Tools", and add an IP access rule for "Tor" with action "Allow". ([jhxy](https://fosstodon.org/@jhxy/106066472212870341))
- If need to check your IP address, is a nifty tool. It even has a JSON output: is hosted behind CloudFlare, so if you access it using curl via Tor, you get a CAPTCHA page.Hilariously, that page contains the IP address you reached the site from. So you still get to check your IP address anyway.Such protecc. Many wow. ([rysiek](https://mastodon.social/@rysiek/106048658721437726))
- the DNS is a separate matter than the reverse proxy. But that still sounds like bad advice. CloudFlare is not trustworthy and you wouldn't want them to be able to keep track of your DNS resolutions. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/105923899340769618))
- Cloudflare wants to become the gatekeeper of the internet and control everything that wants to pass. Extensive monitoring of a profit driven company plus access for US intelligence. Mozilla is acting as a honeypot by redirecting Firefox users there. ([umwerker](https://todon.nl/@UmWerker/105917456753697117))
- This "Cypherpunk.is" site wrote an article about how CloudFlare is a honeypot selling snake oil and now they have become a CF site themselves. They deleted their article hoping no one would notice, but we found it: hypocrisy ([batalanto](https://todon.nl/@batalanto/105914555299295229))
- Ich bin mir sicher, dass du eine Antwort bekommst. Nur bin ich mir sicher, dass die sich nicht wieder wirklich darauf einlassen, das Ding zu deaktivieren.

Was der Struktur des Internets zu Urteilen nie Sinn und Zweck war ([kromonos](https://social.snopyta.org/@kromonos/104258729962672240))
- I have never in my life subscribed to cloudflare's blog and I just now got this email to both EMAIL and EMAIL. It appears to actually be from Cloudflare and not someone spoofing their address. This is the second time I've had to unsubscribe from their shit after never even subscribing in the first place. ([Amolith](https://nixnet.social/notice/A46bGevUkh70Hlh7zc))
- Du hast eine Domain bei INWX liegen? Du findest cloudflare scheiße? Dann schreib bitte eine Mail an den Support, dass die cloudflare für deren Webseite bitte wieder abschalten sollen. Ja, aktuell ist die ganze Seite samt Zertifikat von bzw. hinter Cloudflare versteckt. Je mehr Leute sich beschweren, desto besser stehen die Erfolgschancen. Bitte teilen! ([nuron](https://social.tchncs.de/@nuron/104258767881075941))
- Wenn wir von heute auf morgen alle über TOR Routen würden, wäre Cloudflare auf einmal nicht mehr scheiß egal. ([kromonos](https://social.snopyta.org/@kromonos/104213914131776937))
- The election system is broken in terms of privacy. Citizens are forced to decide: 1) give up the right to vote, or 2) share their physical address with the state, who will then publish it for anyone to access. On top of that, 8 states now force all voters to share the public info + their SSN or DL with CloudFlare Inc.I think Alaska is the only state sensible enough to give voters a way to keep their physical address private. by [aktivismoestasmialuo](https://activism.openworlds.info/@aktivismoEstasMiaLuo/104304629350973064))

- they've censored LGBT resources under sexual content with their DNS scheme, they harass tor users with captchas to access almost all their websites by default, which pins tracking information to you in an attempt to deanonymize you (Its s Google Captcha, what do you expect). They've consolidated a large part of the web and its traffic under their control and undermine the idea that encrypted web connections should be going directly to a site, untampered with.So if you're a large company with a stranglehold on internet traffic, the ability to track users, and view the unencrypted contents of their connections, what do you think is an obvious way to profit?Don't trust CloudFlare.

- Today first I successfully did a search on opensubtitles.org with Firefox and noticed that this site uses CloudFlare. Then later on I tried to do a search on opensubtitles.org with the Tor browser. I got the Google ReCaptcha, and after solving that for more than 10 to 15 times, where it seemed to give me access a few times, I was still not able to perform a search at all (meh) :_catsad: When will people realize that the free of charge for 1 website DDOS protection by CloudFlare is not at all a cool and free option to choose for. It is more like selling your soul and poisoning the Internet. Also : A few months ago I had to use the CloudFlare web admin interface for a friend. I added a subdomain for an admin login page for the website of my friend. Then I continued working on the site and suddenly noticed in the logs that the brand new subdomain was visited by several different ones, including a tor node. At first I got confused by it, and I found it very unpleasant, but in the end my conclusion is that CloudFlare is just dodgy. I hope that affordable CDN and DDOS protection alternatives will grow and vanish CloudFlare in the end. ([Ajz](https://mastodon.host/@Ajz))
- If you're at a small scale, why would you pretend you need the services that CloudFlare provides in the first place? I understand that people watching MSM and have little knowledge of IT will think that everyone in the world is constantly being DDoSed every time they make a post on their blog, but that's just not the case.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/0e1fe9a1-1099-4091-899b-69130f309a6e))
-  I understand the marketing team has a lot of other functionalities that you can list in order to make it look less bad, but you're still doing all your users a massive disservice by employing CloudFlare inbetween them and your service. No matter how many cool features you think you're getting for gratis, you're still handing all your customer data to them, essentially through having them become the middle man of the man in the middle scheme. Paying for that service is even more ridiculous from any sane perspective.  ([fglt](https://soc.fglt.nl/objects/e3a57b9a-a80d-4d2b-a44f-de8b166dba00))

- Cloudflare and Google captcha are the worst enemies of tor. ([lexa](https://mstdn.io/@lexa/103356277680824722))
- BTW, it doesn't matter who your CA is, the tunnel between outsiders & CF's site always terminates at CF.  So, for example, if you were a mastodon.social user, CF would see your username & unhashed pw full stop. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359038780017782))
- CloudFlare blocks from the reader's side, not the author.  If Alice blogs on a CF site then Bob is blocked from reading it if CF objects to Bob's IP address-browser pair.  And that's not theoretical -- it's certain. CF dictates who can reach who.  CF also pushes surveillanceCapitalism via a forced Google-served CAPTCHA (depending on IP-browser pair).  Using a CF service gives them power.  Twentyfivebux unwittingly supports centralization & empowers CF by using mastodon.social. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103358978513641848))
- Sure there are many instances.  Some are respecting of freedom & privacy, and some are not.  CloudFlare is an abuser of privacy & netneutrality.  You've specifically endorsed a CF node (mastodon.social). As a privacy foundation, you should know better and you should set a better example. ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359630910309671))
-  CloudFlare sites like mastodon.social are profoundly stupid choices to endorse. Even if you neglect the Tor hostility & VPN weakness, CF still sees all traffic.  Also, using CF feeds a privacy abuser financially, which works against your alleged cause.  ([resist1984](https://social.privacytools.io/@resist1984/103359717636003316))
- I'm more concerned with Clouflare's dominance (~75% of high-traffic websites on internet) regarding caching HTTPS in exchange for website owners private keys (in effect silently compromising  all visitors to said sites as well). After digging into Cloudbleed and the technical solution at Cloudflare making this security bug possible, along with their transparency  (www.cloudflare.com/transparency/), it became apparent that this is the biggest orchestrated HTTPS weakness out there serving US government.

- On a more serious note, I know a lot of people believe using Cloudflare automagically makes their site more secure because of the green lock indicating that fact. I can understand it more for people using crappy webhosts that you can't get certs from Let's Encrypt with. For people who run their own servers, there is no excuse for putting CF in the middle and giving them access to all their users' traffic. It's just stupid.

- Security: every site that uses it, Cloudflare is a proxy that intercepts all the traffic. It can therefore correlate individual user traffic across every site that uses/embeds cloudflare site/resources. Single point of security failure, from a global surveillance point of view.

- Das Linux Magazin nennt die Nutzung der CloudFlare Reverse-Proxy Server als CDN ... Wenn das CDN ist, was ist dann das Ausliefern einzelner Dateien über einen extra Server?)
- CloudFlare kann echt bald von jedem ein Bewegungsprofil erstellen, dagegen sind die Fahrzeuge von Google Maps ein scheiß ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102475706977537396))
- Lustig, wie selbst INWX in ihren Datenschutzerklärungen in keinster Weise CloudFlare erwähnt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102474883800543138))
- It's because cloudflare actively spies on traffic going through it, so any service connected to it is compromised by default. Even if the service itself is well-meaning and wants to respect privacy, just having cloudflare there ruins all of it. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102457243116505761))
- Cloudflare had a unchecked regex expression they rolled out to live service without testing and it broke half the Internet. ([Bluedepth](https://mastodon.technology/@Bluedepth/102457244936687401))
- Wenn ich mir die Möglichkeiten ansehe, die ich mit nginx habe, Log Dateien zu schreiben, läuft mir echt ein eiskalter Schauer über den Rücken,weil ich mir ausmalen kann,welchen Preis Besucher von Webseiten hinter Cloudflare Proxy Servern bezahlen. Wenn ich das ganze dann hoch rechne...Die könnten ein komplettes bewegungsprofil eines jeden erstellen. Und Google wird durch das Captcha direkt mit gefüttert.)
- Ich als Anbieter könnte echt nicht mit dem Gewissen leben,meine Besucher so zu verkaufen ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102458133671163498))
- Mit Serverstandort Deutschland zu werben, nutzt einen scheißdreck, wenn man den Server hinter den USA Proxys von CloudFlare versteckt. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102457750251926436))
- Really disappointed and a little disgusted by the Matrix team. Putting Cloudflare spyware on their main instance, forcing every user to either go through the malicious wall or to use a homeserver that doesn't federate with matrix.org thus cutting itself off from just about everything. Will be giving XMPP a go today. Wonder if that community has even the tiniest bit of respect for users. ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456355379841384))
- Even the main instance uses Cloudflare. New users will probably just use the main instance for convenience. ([RMW](https://linuxrocks.online/@RMW))
- I use to think it was cool that you can pay a little bit and have your own instance but it sucks that they put every instance behind Cloudflare. ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/101918685210269597))
- Don't laugh when cloudflare says “the network is the computer.” They mean surveillance and they mean the surveillance goes all the way to the endpoints. Boycott them and their nefarious agenda. ([roy](https://pleroma.site/objects/1ddf444d-0f2c-4d0d-bc11-e06f28efd5bc))
- I think I've found an alternative to Cloudflare Liberapay. I'm going to set Fosspay up this evening and start replacing Liberapay links on my website ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102436150784521976))
- I'm sad that the Crimeflare got deleted because they'd be having a field day today. cloudflare ([DashEquals](https://ap.torlipen.net/objects/5f1b65fc-499d-4312-b20e-7b0cb9dd7ee2))
- All I want is a privacy respecting messaging platform that does group conversations and voice chat, does that *really* have to be a big ask? Been really put off Matrix with the Cloudflare bullshit and their attitude towards it. There are whole papers on the issues with it. When will this fucking nightmare end? I need suggestions. What things do other people use for this stuff? ([OTheB](https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB/102456866393573493))
- Hi pixelfed! You just added a mandatory Cloudflare ajax service to pixelfed.social? The page is empty now... ([antonlopez](https://mastodon.social/@antonlopez/102451687366539901))
- Ich nutz hauptsächlich Tor. Zwar heuchelt Cloudflare Tor-Freundlich zu sein, z.B. mit eigener Onion Adresse. Aber standardmäßig blocken die Tor Verbindungen, sofern man sie nicht freigibt.)
- Zudem empfinde ich es nicht gerade als Datenschutzfreundlich, die Cloudflare Proxy Server zu nutzen. Vor allem, da Cloudflare dem Patriot Act untersteht. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102440347862158580))
- außerdem empfinde ich persönlich es als Wohltuend, wenn die CloudFlare Fanboys mal genauso auf ein Forbidden stoßen, wie TOR User all zu gern bei CloudFlare ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102447153687932571))
- I think that I will stop using it, until they remove it from Cloudflare. I don't see it as something that is made for privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare for their main instance. ([Robin](https://welovela.in/objects/456f3bba-ee24-48c5-92a3-7f80349dfbc3))
- angesprochen sollten auch nur jene werden, die keine Ahnung haben, aber dann so tun, als hätten sie sie. IT Blogger, die Anleitungen dazu bringen, wie man die Tor Exit Knoten Liste herunter lädt um die IP Adressen dann zu blockieren. Weil CloudFlare ja gesagt hat.)
- Und jene, die keine Ahnung haben ... denen ist die Meinung der wirklichen Experten scheiß egal. Die lauschen lieber auf jene, die mit ihrem gefährlichen Halbwissen das Internet verpesten. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102445550843368442))
- Hyperbola members who don't care about Cloudflare, which disrepect the privacy over violation of rule 3 of the social contract ([HarvettFox96](https://hostux.social/@HarvettFox96/102414243375270600))
- Remember how the liars at cloudflare pretended that had come under attack (causing major downtime), only later to admit that they broke their own service because they're technically incompetent. Avoid them. ([schestowitz](https://pleroma.site/objects/a5533839-4678-4c06-975f-5ceceeaa793d))

- They use cloudflare for their Matrix.org and other servers they operate. ([eo](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@eo/102396215079147841))
- They talk about decentralization, while being behind cloudflare. awesome ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102387933088472002))
- It's been estimated that today's Cloudflare outage is effecting about 10% of all websites world-wide. If a lot of your online world is down right now, your word and research topic for the day is decentralization ([raye](https://sunbeam.city/@raye/102372447641525998))
- Seems like the world's biggest MiTM is down and took a rather large number of websites with it ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102372539142565301))
- So I guess Liberapay is behind TheGreatCloudwall now ([amolith](https://masto.nixnet.xyz/@amolith/102207994379806531))
- I want to thank Cloudflare for removing themselves from the internet. ([Chuculate](https://niu.moe/@Chuculate/102378374675476776))
- Yesterday it was cloudflare today it's facebook static content (images etc) don't load, seems like CDN problems too. Welcome to the centralized Internet... ([kravietz](https://social.privacytools.io/@kravietz/102378733712987218))
- Qué es Cloudflare, cómo funciona y por qué cuando se cae parte de internet se viene abajo ([GeekTale](https://mastodon.social/@GeekTale/102376704390517130))
- Вчера упал CloudFlare, из-за чего нарушилась работа крупнейших сервисов Интернета. Разработчики уже выпустили пост-мортем, из которого следует, что причиной падения стало – внимание – регулярное выражение, вызвавшее 100% нагрузку на CPU и, вследствие чего, множество 502-х ошибок в ответ на запросы.

- LMAO cloudflare is down AGAIN? ([DashEquals](https://ap.torlipen.net/objects/4236a828-7ba9-4c2c-9c40-c217c1f1d4e3))
- Natürlich bezahlst du nichts, dafür aber deine Besucher, die all ihre Daten und Metadaten einem in den USA durch den PatriotAct verpflichteten Dienst in den Rachen werfen. Noch dazu ein Dienst, der auf den meisten Seiten Tor blockiert. Fehler hin oder her ... Wer Datenschutz ernst nimmt, verzichtet auf Cloudflare und ähnliche Dienste. Und wer doch einen Proxy vor seinem eigentlichen Dienst brauch, kann ihn ja selbst aufsetzen. ([kromonos](https://metalhead.club/@kromonos/102372968538354130))

- It makes it really hard for us Tor-users to use liberapay actually. We do know about Under Attack mode already, and I would like you to reconsider and not use cloudflare :) ([selea](https://social.linux.pizza/@selea/102208159022447946))

- No deja de llamar la atencion, que la inmensa mayoria de las instancias del fediverso usen cloudflare, el PEOR enemigo de la privacidad y el anonimato. ¿Sabian que cloudflare considera a Tor una importante fuente de ataques DDoS, cuando no existen estudios que lo demuestren?
