- @com @jerry So I wonder if using Cloudflare actually eased their effort in passing an audit, because they can probably tick a bunch of boxes that say ‚Äúnot our problem‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs on Cloudflare‚Äôs side of the fence‚Äù. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108221845275233039))
- Someone who sees DeepL‚Äôs security statement would be convinced that they are in good hands if they knew nothing about Cloudflare -- which likely describes a majority of those who encounter DeepL. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108219864107489894))
- I can understand why DeepL is so driven to mislead users about their security -- it‚Äôs a profit-driven corporation. But why does the LibreTranslate.com admin mislead users about security? They don‚Äôt even have a donation link. They have no reason to be malicious &amp; harm the ‚Äúlibre‚Äù brand. It would cost them nothing to warn users that all queries are shared with Cloudflare. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108219905100511124))
- DeepL‚Äôs use of Cloudflare whilst showcasing ISO 27001 compliance really demonstrates well the insufficiency of iso27001. DeepL shows how well a Cloudflare website can decorate the security disclosures of a service while sharing every bit of everyone‚Äôs data with a MitM. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108219851714554080))
- @MarcoMeer @davidoclubb @Blort Yes I have. DeepL chose their words carefully. Their ‚Äústate of the art TLS‚Äù is compromized when another org holds the keys &amp; performs the decryption. Their e2e crypto terminates at Cloudflare‚Äôs data center not their own. They say they delete you text immediately have translation, but it‚Äôs too late b/c they‚Äôve already shown it to an untrustworthy tech giant.

- Mastodon Pro-tip: if you&39;re struggling to get your website verified on your profile and your website is behind Cloudflare, you have to disable &quot;Bot Fight Mode&quot; under Security =&gt; Bots. Then you have to modify something in your Mastodon &quot;Bio&quot; and save to re-trigger the verification attempt. ([andryou](https://mastodon.social/@andryou/108218913202599968))
- @dromografos Horrible privacy risks exposed! Tonight, on Cloudflare! ([Coffee@toot.cafe](https://toot.cafe/@Coffee/108217640750755724))
- The lesson here, I guess: check the WAF logs in detail before assuming anything's not a CloudFlare issue! More specifically, if anyone else has weird federation issues and uses CloudFlare in front of their site - you need to disable "Bot Fight Mode" under "Security -&gt; Bots" in the dashboard - else federation won't work properly. I have sent CloudFlare a request to fix this on their end too! ([curtispf@mashed.cloud](https://social.mashed.cloud/@curtispf/108216873140742765))

- Finde den Fehler Microsoft Edge bekommt ‚ÄûSicheres Netzwerk‚Äú (VPN) verpasst. Das Microsoft Edge Secure Network ist ein Dienst, der in Zusammenarbeit mit Cloudflare bereitgestellt wird.

- @nielsa Fascism is the melding of govt with big business, the rest are symptoms, things that manifest as a by-product of such fascism. Our sources are reliable re banks censoring and unpersoning. If you have TorBrowser hit Ctrl+Shift+E before loading a website. Quickly you'll learn why CloudFlare is not what it seems. ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108208651228597728))
- @nielsa So Facebook and Twitter are in the advertising, data broking and Public Relations industry. They are bad enough but‚Ä¶ They are better than CloudFlare for sovereignty (mostly because everyone knows about what they are doing). When Fbook tried to be a bank we went into overdrive. CloudFlare (and akamai, lesser Amazon and Azure) control/block almost all Australian banks and payment rails, and by proxy and stealth. Its infinately worse, there is no comparison here. Its an attack. ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108208413666886488))
- @nielsa Saying efforts to avoid Cloudflare (and Azure, Amazon and Akamai) is "entirely ridiculous" flys in the face of people, who have jumped ship when we talk to them. Every 'one' person who learns of the centralisation and NetNeutering-nature of the fascist CDN networks is priceless. We don't need to friend, follow people on Cf servers because their takes are, let's just say, low-octane, funnily enough. Stay on CloudFlare if you dare.

- @Blort @davidoclubb (update) DeepL is a no-go from a privacy standpoint -- just found out they share your sensitive translations with Cloudflare, thus privacy is in the shitter. I suggest installing ArgosTranslate and running it locally. ([koherecoWatchdog@freeradical.zone](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/108183092593257572))

- @icedquinn Sustainable Australia Party used to call these "de facto standards" "naturalMonopolies". They used to argue that such natural monopolies must be made public. They may still do, but we can no longer access their site as cloudFlare blocks access to it. Cloudflare serve a number of other minorParty websites, all of which are inaccessible.

- @fedithom @fdroidorg You need to separate the facts from the judgment. The irrefutable fact is that Cloudflare sees all data going to CF-hosted Fdroid servers incl. ssl. What Cloudflare harvests from the F-droid mirrors is anyone‚Äôs guess b/c those facts are concealed from the public. Even if Cloudflare were to claim not to, they‚Äôve been caught making false statements before, thus untrustworthy. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168770251173981))
- @fdroidorg @iska The answer is the website, for now. Experts &amp; streetwise users are being driven off the Fdroid app but the fdroid website is still easy to detect Cloudflare on (there are a number of tools to do this) and then sideload the apps. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168857872534511))
- @fdroidorg @iska There is a project dedicated to finding Cloudflare websites. It‚Äôs such a huge undertaking that the project struggles to keep up with it. This is nothing that you could reasonably expect each Fdroid user to undertake on their own. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168878863849485))
- @iska @fdroidorg What‚Äôs a specific firewall implementation that gives users the option of using a custom filter? BTW, you‚Äôre not just blocking one IP address. Cloudflare has around ~10-15% of all websites in the world. That‚Äôs a lot of IPs stemming from a lot of ASNs, and the ASN lookups are non-trivial because some CF websites are not tagged in the ASN info as belonging to CF. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168867633647833))
- Fdroid is getting dicey for privacy now that are allowing a tech giant to snoop on who fetches which app. Many users choose @fdroidorg for security, but security is compromized when Cloudflare is given reconnaisance data on the apps and versions various users are running. This info opens up Fdroid users to attacks that exploit known bugs. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108165961277908385))
- @fdroidorg I suggest not trusting the Fdroid app itself anymore. By default it enables ~6 mirrors, any of which can become Cloudflared w/out notice. There is no toggle to automatically block or disable Cloudflare hosts. It‚Äôs thus more secure to fetch f-droid apps from the web over Tor, after checking whether a host is CF‚Äôd.
