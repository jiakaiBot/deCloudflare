- Behördenwebsites mit Cloudflare "we are checking your browser" ([quincy@chaos.social](https://chaos.social/@quincy/108179883508136249))
- If you want to opt-out of Visa’s information sharing, you must give your card to Visa’s Cloudflare website. Is this catch22 legal, considering Visa is legally obligated to offer the opt-out? ([koherecoWatchdog@freeradical.zone](https://freeradical.zone/@koherecoWatchdog/108176690207008793))
- Hahaha. Now even CloudFlare'd sites are dropping initial connection attempts. Just die, CloudFlare. cloudFuckd cloudFucked dieCloudFlare ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108174798782492937))
- @fedithom @fdroidorg You need to separate the facts from the judgment. The irrefutable fact is that Cloudflare sees all data going to CF-hosted Fdroid servers incl. ssl. What Cloudflare harvests from the F-droid mirrors is anyone’s guess b/c those facts are concealed from the public. Even if Cloudflare were to claim not to, they’ve been caught making false statements before, thus untrustworthy.

- @fdroidorg @iska The answer is the website, for now. Experts &amp; streetwise users are being driven off the Fdroid app but the fdroid website is still easy to detect Cloudflare on (there are a number of tools to do this) and then sideload the apps. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168857872534511))
- @fdroidorg @iska There is a project dedicated to finding Cloudflare websites. It’s such a huge undertaking that the project struggles to keep up with it. This is nothing that you could reasonably expect each Fdroid user to undertake on their own. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168878863849485))
- @iska @fdroidorg What’s a specific firewall implementation that gives users the option of using a custom filter? BTW, you’re not just blocking one IP address. Cloudflare has around ~10-15% of all websites in the world. That’s a lot of IPs stemming from a lot of ASNs, and the ASN lookups are non-trivial because some CF websites are not tagged in the ASN info as belonging to CF.

- Fdroid is getting dicey for privacy now that are allowing a tech giant to snoop on who fetches which app. Many users choose @fdroidorg for security, but security is compromized when Cloudflare is given reconnaisance data on the apps and versions various users are running. This info opens up Fdroid users to attacks that exploit known bugs. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108165961277908385))
- @fdroidorg I suggest not trusting the Fdroid app itself anymore. By default it enables ~6 mirrors, any of which can become Cloudflared w/out notice. There is no toggle to automatically block or disable Cloudflare hosts. It’s thus more secure to fetch f-droid apps from the web over Tor, after checking whether a host is CF’d.
