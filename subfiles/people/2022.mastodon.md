- @pluralistic That's what makes a UBI so unappealing to these billionaire influencer-types. They will not be able to wield their billions to pervert the natural laws of society and the environment. By the way, we were at your craphound.com website recently. Wondering if you would like to selfhost a few scripts rather than use cloudflare? ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108288783155040562))
- @2T2 Interesting, but if it is not FOSS then it's effectively malware. We have long been critics of how Mozilla implemented ()DNSOverHTTPS by only using one DNS — a CloudFlare(!) one. Their algorithm is broken by design, it should employ an array of Resolvers. We find there are plenty of FOSS browsers like LibreWolf, IceCat and more, that one can use and if one routes all their DNS Requests to Tor via a TransparentProxy. Then you can start to have a bit of basic privacy. alohaBrowser web3 ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108283518798712291))
- @lebronjames75 We don't even bother with pleasantries like 'liberal' (in 'neoliberal'). We prescribe by ChrisHedges thought that one should be more direct and call them what they are — 'corporatists'. Or at this stage of oligarchy, the term 'fascist' is actually totally valid given the fact these transNational corporate monoliths are so heavily fused with govt they are completely indistinguishable. (ChrisHedges is no longer on RT and is feeding CloudFlare, now) @lain @ratanon ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108283603558208202))
- @bojkotiMalbona I'm frustrated by this too, for additional reasons (MitM and CAPTCHA paywall), but I'd like to have a friendly open discussion about this to hopefully get those numbers down. I'm sure there are various reasons why instance admins let Cloudflare front their service, like out of habit, not thinking of the implications or weighing them in another way, having actually experienced DDoS or other attacks that Cloudflare can actually mitigate and not knowing of or having resources for other recourse. I'm also sure that an even larger portion of the fediverse instances are hosted on major cloud provider infrastructure, many of them masked by being fronted by Cloudflare or other. There are similar concerns there. ([omni@hackers.town](https://hackers.town/@omni/108282720131217253))

- If Mozilla actually tried to make an implementation of DNSOverHttps that was even a little bit ethical the browser would be more usable. Currently a user can only use one DNSResolver at a time, and would need to manually change it away from the default, CloudFlare. Its a bad implementation of (DoH) and it only serves CloudFlare. technoFascists bigData ([dsfgs@activism.openworlds.info](https://activism.openworlds.info/@dsfgs/108279316730261178))
- @ScottMortimer Uh, not sure how to parse your question. “Crimeflare” was a bad name for what is now called “deCloudflare”. They are indeed the ones who produced that fediverse.md file. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108276671346577056))
- @ScottMortimer Why am I blocked? Because Cloudflare objects to my IP address, browser, or combination thereof. So reading statuses that originate from a CFd host end up being a time waster for me. It would be useful to be able to just browse msgs that exist in the free and open world, not walled gardens. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108277237859402471))
- @ScottMortimer It’s unclear why you bring up security, when the issue is about decentralization. Some people come to the fedi for decentralization. But that’s not what they get when Cloudflare centralizes ~19% of the nodes. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108277169602323767))
- @ScottMortimer But among the general public, some are streetwise and capable and choose not to pawn themselves to Cloudflare. Thus they do not connect to Cloudflare services. Apart from the security problem, it’s also a practical problem. That is, as I read fedi posts from a text-based client, sometimes I need to open a status in a full-blown GUI browser but find I’m the one being blocked. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108277224307925286))
- @ScottMortimer If a fedi admin thinks Cloudflare can improve their security, that’s not my problem and I won’t let their security problem become my problem more than necessary. Using the fediverse.md file to separate the free world from the walled garden is one way to address the problem.

- @iska @fdroidorg What’s a specific firewall implementation that gives users the option of using a custom filter? BTW, you’re not just blocking one IP address. Cloudflare has around ~10-15% of all websites in the world.

([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108168867633647833))
- Fdroid is getting dicey for privacy now that are allowing a tech giant to snoop on who fetches which app. Many users choose @fdroidorg for security, but security is compromized when Cloudflare is given reconnaisance data on the apps and versions various users are running. This info opens up Fdroid users to attacks that exploit known bugs. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108165961277908385))
- @fdroidorg I suggest not trusting the Fdroid app itself anymore. By default it enables ~6 mirrors, any of which can become Cloudflared w/out notice. There is no toggle to automatically block or disable Cloudflare hosts. It’s thus more secure to fetch f-droid apps from the web over Tor, after checking whether a host is CF’d.
