- Fdroid is getting dicey for privacy now that are allowing a tech giant to snoop on who fetches which app. Many users choose @fdroidorg for security, but security is compromized when Cloudflare is given reconnaisance data on the apps and versions various users are running. This info opens up Fdroid users to attacks that exploit known bugs. ([bojkotiMalbona@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@bojkotiMalbona/108165961277908385))
- @fdroidorg I suggest not trusting the Fdroid app itself anymore. By default it enables ~6 mirrors, any of which can become Cloudflared w/out notice. There is no toggle to automatically block or disable Cloudflare hosts. It’s thus more secure to fetch f-droid apps from the web over Tor, after checking whether a host is CF’d.
